\subsection*{Step 2: Preprocess the data}

\par Affymetrix Genechip arrays are currently among the most widely used high-throughput technologies for the genome-wide measurement of expression profiles. To minimize mis- and cross-hybridization problems, this technology includes both perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) probe pairs as well as multiple probes per gene (Lipshutz et al., 1999). As a result, significant preprocessing is required before an absolute expression level for a specific gene may be accurately assessed. In general, preprocessing probe-level expression data consists of three steps: background adjustment (remove local artifacts and ``noise"), normalization (remove array effects), and summarization at the probe set level (combine probe intensities across arrays to obtain a measure of the expression level of corresponding mRNA). The Pipeline allows the user to select from the following popular preprocessing techniques: Microarray suite 5 (MAS5), Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) and Guanine Cytosine Robust Multi-Array Analysis (GCRMA).
