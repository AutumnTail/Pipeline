abstract = {The better-than-average effect is a particular type of social comparison, one in which people compare their characteristics or behaviors against a norm or standard, which is usually the average standing of their peers on the characteristic. In this regard, the better-than-average effect falls outside the mainstream of traditional social comparison theory. Following Festinger (1954), social comparison theorists have emphasized the precursors and consequences of comparisons between people. Arguably, however, comparisons with normative standards are at least as prevalent as interpersonal comparisons. The self versus average peer judgments studied in better-than-average effect research are akin to social comparisons such as assessing whether one is meeting a group's moral standards or performance expectations. The better-than-average effect is considered to be one of the most robust of all self-enhancement phenomena (Taylor {\&} Brown, 1988; Sedikides {\&} Gregg, 2003). The better-than-average effect shares this distinction with the optimistic bias--the tendency to overestimate one's chances of good fortune and to underestimate one's risk for misfortune. Whereas the better-than-average effect pertains to self versus average peer comparisons on behavior and trait dimensions, the optimistic bias involves comparisons about life events such as winning the lottery or getting divorced. Although we concentrate on the better-than-average effect in this chapter, many of the issues underlying better-than-average judgments apply as well to relative risk assessments. Connections and distinctions between these two research areas will be drawn throughout this chapter. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

annote = {This book chapter is cited in my thesis just as part of the introductory literature.


The authors explain the better-than-average effect which is pretty self-explanatory: people tend to measure their own skills as above those of others.


The authors cite previous work on the topic that attempt to explain the origin of the phenomenon. Possible causes include a common tendency to selectively targeting people with perceived lower skills when one is measuring one's capability.


The authors cite a previous demontration of the phenomenon in a study conducted in 1976. Of approximately one million students who took the SAT test around 70{\%} rated themselves as above-average leaders. The majority of them also rated themselves as above the median in terms of athletic and social skills. Most remarkable about the results is that the test subjects in this case are not comparing themselves directly against others, and instead are simply evaluating their own abilities.


This experiment is not formally published apparently, because it is not cited by the authors as a paper. I cite this book chapter in my thesis to refer to this experiment.},

abstract = {The upregulation of glycolysis in cancer cells (the "Warburg effect") is common and has implications for prognosis and treatment. As it is energetically inefficient under adequate oxygen supply, its adaptive value for a tumor remains unclear. It has been suggested that the acidity produced by glycolysis is beneficial for cancer cells because it promotes proliferation against normal cells. Current models of this acid-mediated tumor invasion hypothesis, however, do not account for increased glycolysis under non-limiting oxygen concentrations and therefore do not fully explain the Warburg effect. Here I show that the Warburg effect can be explained as a form of cooperation among cancer cells, in which the products of glycolysis act as a public good, even when oxygen supply is high enough to make glycolysis energetically inefficient. A multiplayer game with non-linear, non-monotonic payoff functions that models the benefits of the acidity induced by glycolysis reveals that clonal selection can stabilize glycolysis even when energetically costly, that is, under non-limiting oxygen concentration. Characterizing the evolutionary dynamics of glycolysis reveals cases in which anti-cancer therapies that rely on the modification of acidity can be effective.},

abstract = {Tumor heterogeneity is well documented for many characters, including the production of growth factors, which improve tumor proliferation and promote resistance against apoptosis and against immune reaction. What maintains heterogeneity remains an open question that has implications for diagnosis and treatment. While it has been suggested that therapies targeting growth factors are robust against evolved resistance, current therapies against growth factors, like antiangiogenic drugs, are not effective in the long term, as resistant mutants can evolve and lead to relapse. We use evolutionary game theory to study the dynamics of the production of growth factors by monolayers of cancer cells and to understand the effect of therapies that target growth factors. The dynamics depend on the production cost of the growth factor, on its diffusion range and on the type of benefit it confers to the cells. Stable heterogeneity is a typical outcome of the dynamics, while a pure equilibrium of nonproducer cells is possible under certain conditions. Such pure equilibrium can be the goal of new anticancer therapies. We show that current therapies, instead, can be effective only if growth factors are almost completely eliminated and if the reduction is almost immediate.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Game theory suggests an anti-cancer treatment based on the use of modified cancer cells that disrupt cooperation within the tumor. Cancer cells are harvested from the patient, the genes for the production of essential growth factors are knocked out in vitro and the cells are then reinserted in the tumor, where they lead to its collapse.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Current anti-cancer drugs and treatments based on gene therapy are prone to the evolution of resistance, because cancer is a process of clonal selection: resistant cell lines have a selective advantage and therefore increase in frequency, eventually conferring resistance to the whole tumor and leading to relapse. An effective treatment must be evolutionarily stable, that is, immune to the invasion of resistant mutant cells. This study shows how such a treatment can be achieved by autologous cell therapy using modified cancer cells, knocked out for genes coding for diffusible factors like growth factors.

METHODOLOGY: The evolutionary dynamics of a population of cells producing diffusible factors are analyzed using a nonlinear public goods game in a structured population in which the interaction neighborhood and the update neighborhood are decoupled. The analysis of the dynamics of the system reveals what interventions can drive the population to a stable equilibrium in which no diffusible factors are produced.

RESULTS: A treatment based on autologous knockout cell therapy can be designed to lead to the spontaneous collapse of a tumor, without targeting directly the cancer cells, their growth factors or their receptors. Critical parameters that can make the therapy effective are identified. Concepts from evolutionary game theory and mechanism design, some of which are counterintuitive, can be adopted to optimize the treatment.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Although it shares similarities with other approaches based on gene therapy and RNA interference, the method suggested here is evolutionarily stable under certain conditions. This method, named autologous cell defection, can be carried out using existing molecular biology and cell therapy techniques.},

abstract = {Animal communication theory predicts that low-frequency cheating should be common in generally honest signalling systems. However, perhaps because cheats are designed to go undetected, there are few examples of dishonest signals in natural populations. Here we present what we believe is the first example of a dishonest signal which is used commonly by males to attract mates and fight sexual rivals. After losing their large claw male fiddler crabs (Uca annulipes) grow a new one which has less mass, is a less effective weapon and costs less to use in signalling than an equivalent-length claw of the original form. Males with original claws do not differentially fight males with regenerated claws even though they are likely to win. Regenerated claws effectively bluff fighting ability and deter potential opponents before they fight. During mate searching, females do not discriminate against males with low-mass, regenerated claws, indicating that they are deceived as to the true costs males pay to produce sexual signals. Up to 44{\%} of males in natural populations have regenerated claws, a level unanticipated by current signalling theory. The apparent rarity of cheating may be an artefact of the usual difficulty of detecting cheats and dishonesty may be quite common.},

However there are two standard cases where the associated covariance matrix does not exist and the conventional prior of Zellner cannot be used: if the number of observations is lower than the number of variables (large p and small n paradigm), or if some variables are linear combinations of others. In such situations, a prior distribution derived from the prior of Zellner can be considered by introducing a ridge parameter. This prior is a flexible and simple adaptation of the g-prior and its influence on the selection of variables is studied. A simple way to choose the associated hyper-parameters is proposed. The method is valid for any generalized linear mixed model and particular attention is paid to the study of probit mixed models when some variables are linear combinations of others. The method is applied to both simulated and real datasets obtained from Affymetrix microarray experiments. Results are compared to those obtained with the Bayesian Lasso. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For example, based on gene sequence and microsatellite data, the method has been used to choose between competing models of human demographic history as well as to infer growth rates, times of divergence, and other parameters. The method fits naturally in the Bayesian inferential framework, and a brief overview is given of the key concepts. Three main approaches to ABC have been developed, and these are described and compared. Although the method arose in population genetics, ABC is increasingly used in other fields, including epidemiology, systems biology, ecology, and agent-based modeling, and many of these applications are briefly described.},

While this method is based upon the theoretical works of Del Moral et al. (2006), the application to approximate Bayesian computation results in a bias in the approximation to the posterior. An alternative version based on genuine importance sampling arguments bypasses this difficulty, in connection with the population Monte Carlo method of Cappe et al. (2004), and it includes an automatic scaling of the forward kernel. When applied to a population genetics example, it compares favourably with two other versions of the approximate algorithm.},

abstract = {We propose a new method for approximate Bayesian statistical inference on the basis of summary statistics. The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

We then give an alternative interpretation in terms of set-valued set functions that encapsulate the production rules of the individual reactions. From the mathematical point of view, these functions define generalized topological spaces on the set of chemical species. We show that organization-theoretic concepts also appear in a natural way in the topological language. This abstract representation in turn suggests the exploration of the chemical meaning of well-established topological concepts. As an example, we consider connectedness in some detail.},

The authors aim to link two explanations of why animals sometimes convey honest information to others. These two explanations are as follows:




1. Costly signalling theory (the handicap principle): High-quality individuals make costly exhibitions that could not be afforded by low-quality individuals. Therefore the receiver knows that any individual performing such costly exhibitions are high-quality.




2. Index hypothesis: dishonest signals cannot be faked because an individual's signal growth depends on the individual's quality. That is, individuals' signals are constrained by the individuals' quality.




Recent tests support explanation 2. And the authors present a model to show that both types of honest signalling evolve by the same factors.




Wha the authors aim to conclude is that all explanations for the evolution of honest signalling are related, not separated.




That is to say, the relationship between individual quality and signla strength (index hypothesis) does not belittle the relevance of the costs incurred into by conveying honest signals.},

abstract = {Models for the steps of organisation in the origin of life are discussed with an emphasis on stability, and the possibilities of acquiring a diversity of functions. In particular, two basic models are described: that of simple self-replicating molecules, and that of autocatalytic self-reproduction, which is accomplished by a hypercyclic organisation. The latter may be exemplified by the RNA world. The view of a step-wise development with new functions successively incorporated and a high accuracy of the reproduction from the onset is criticised. Instead, we suggest that no clear systematic information is continued to the first cell before the start of protein synthesis. A non-selective manifold of self-replicating molecules and unsystematic protein production from the beginning could have caused a very large diversity from which functions that could stabilise the system by feedback loops could be selected. The only way to stabilise the protein synthesis and the genetic code would be to have feedback mechanisms so that the code actually produced the proteins that supported that very code. The code would then become frozen. As DNA would require control functions, it would not be used as a single information-carrier until protein synthesis had been established and the functions were available.},

The new method fits a nonlinear conditional heteroscedastic regression of the parameter on the summary statistics, and then adaptively improves estimation using importance sampling. The new algorithm is compared to the state-of-the-art approximate Bayesian methods, and achieves considerable reduction of the computational burden in two examples of inference in statistical genetics and in a queueing model.},

abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods make use of comparisons between simulated and observed summary statistics to overcome the problem of computationally intractable likelihood functions. As the practical implementation of ABC requires computations based on vectors of summary statistics, rather than full datasets, a central question is how to derive low dimensional summary statistics from the observed data with minimal loss of information. In this article we provide a comprehensive review and comparison of the performance of the principal methods of dimension reduction proposed in the ABC literature. The methods are split into three non-mutually exclusive classes consisting of best subset selection methods, projection techniques and regularisation. In addition, we introduce two new methods of dimension reduction. The first is a best subset selection method based on Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, and the second uses ridge regression as a regularisation procedure. We illustrate the performance of these dimension reduction techniques through the analysis of three challenging models and datasets.},

annote = {Cited by "Hypercycles versus Parasites in a Two Dimensional Partial Differential Equations Model."

First of all: the author's interpretation of a hypercycle is only what Eigen described as a catalytic cycle, not a catalytic hypercycle.

Spirals appear only with a minimum of five species. With less there seems to be no resistance against any parasite. Parasites manage to kill a hypercycle only if it gets to the centre of the spiral. If it does not reach the center it most likely dies or survives only as a cyst within the spiral.

A spiral can be seen as a single individual that comes as the result of the cooperation of the species within. Competition between spirals is possible.

Spatial slef-structuring affects the vulnerability of a hypercycle to parasites and the spiral form renders it almost invulnerable.

A random initial state evolves into a general pattern where a spiral is formed.

A parasite tends to move outward of the spiral, searching for placess where it can easily get support for the parasitised species without having to compete against others that may be stronger. Eventually the parasite is led out of the hypercycle and dies. When the parasite is loceted exaclty in the centre of the spiral it may succeed in killing the hypercycle but it will eventually have to compete with other hypercycles that will kill it easily and proceed to occupy its area. In some cases the parasite may survive inactively as some sort of "cyst." Higher rates of diffusion make the spirals less vulnerable and larger.

The experiments seem to show that in a toroidal CA there must always be a clockwise and an anticlockwise spiral complementing each other.

The results contrast with those obtained with PDE models where a parasite always invades a hypercycle.},

abstract = {The effect of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection on cellular mRNA accumulation was analyzed by gene chip technology. During a 48-h time course after infection of human diploid fibroblasts, 1,425 cellular mRNAs were found to be up-regulated or down-regulated by threefold or greater in at least two consecutive time points. Several classes of genes were prominently affected, including interferon response genes, cell cycle regulators, apoptosis regulators, inflammatory pathway genes, and immune regulators. The number of mRNAs that were up-regulated or down-regulated were roughly equal over the complete time course. However, for the first 8 h after infection, the number of up-regulated mRNAs was significantly less than the number of down-regulated mRNAs. By analyzing the mRNA expression profile of cells infected in the presence of cycloheximide, it was found that a minimum of 25 mRNAs were modulated by HCMV in the absence of protein synthesis. These included mRNAs encoded by a small number of interferon-responsive genes, as well as beta interferon itself. Cellular mRNA levels in cytomegalovirus-infected cells were compared to the levels in cells infected with UV-inactivated virus. The inactivated virus caused the up-regulation of a much greater number of mRNAs, many of which encoded proteins with antiviral roles, such as interferon-responsive genes and proinflammatory cytokines. These data argue that one or more newly synthesized viral gene products block the induction of antiviral pathways that are triggered by HCMV binding and entry.},

Our purpose is to take into account the competition for a re- source (as it can be light or nutrients in a forest) in the growth of the individuals and study the influence of this nonlinear growth in the population dynamics. We study the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the model equations, and also prove the existence of a (compact) global attractor for the trajectories of the dynamical system defined by the solutions of the model. Finally, we obtain sufficient conditions for the convergence to a stationary size distribution when the total population tends to a constant value, and consider some simple examples that allow us to know something about their global dynamics.},

Understanding the dynamics of this gene regulatory network allows us to infer the mechanisms involved in a host response to an external stimulus and hence aids the discovery of biomarkers of phenotype and biological function. In this article, we propose a pipeline for dynamic gene expression data, called Pipeline4DGEData, which consists of a series of statistical modeling techniques that constructs dynamic gene regulatory networks from the large volumes of high-dimensional time course gene expression data that are freely available on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository. This pipeline has a consistent and scalable structure that allows it to simultaneously analyze the data available on GEO and then integrate the results across different studies. We apply the proposed pipeline to influenza infection data from nine studies and demonstrate that interesting biological findings can be discovered with its implementation. Keywords},

In density regulated, structured populations, where individual state influences fate, simple and widely used approaches based on individual lifetime measures of fitness are difficult to justify. We combine recently developed structured population modelling tools with ideas from modern evolutionary game theory (adaptive dynamics) to understand selection on allocation of female reproductive effort to singletons or twins in a size-structured population of feral sheep. In marked contrast to the classical selection analyses, our model-based approach predicts that the female allocation strategy is under negligible directional selection. These differences arise because classical selection analysis ignores components of offspring fitness and fails to consider selection over the complete life cycle.},

The mechanisms that produce this pattern are not completely known, but several previous studies have suggested environmental heterogeneity as a cause. In experiments with evolving digital organisms and populations of fixed size, maximum species richness emerges at intermediate productivity, even in a spatially homogeneous environment, owing to frequency-dependent selection to exploit an influx of mixed resources. A diverse pool of limiting resources is sufficient to cause adaptive radiation, which is manifest by the origin and maintenance of phenotypically and phylogenetically distinct groups of organisms.},

abstract = {Two contrasting approaches to the analysis of population dynamics are currently popular: demographic approaches where the associations between demographic rates and statistics summarizing the population dynamics are identified; and time series approaches where the associations between population dynamics, population density, and environmental covariates are investigated. In this paper, we develop an approach to combine these methods and apply it to detailed data from Soay sheep (Ovis aries). We examine how density dependence and climate contribute to fluctuations in population size via age- and sex-specific demographic rates, and how fluctuations in demographic structure influence population dynamics. Density dependence contributes most, followed by climatic variation, age structure fluctuations and interactions between density and climate. We then simplify the density-dependent, stochastic, age-structured demographic model and derive a new phenomenological time series which captures the dynamics better than previously selected functions. The simple method we develop has potential to provide substantial insight into the relative contributions of population and individual-level processes to the dynamics of populations in stochastic environments.},

abstract = {1. There is a growing number of empirical reports of environmental change simultaneously influencing population dynamics, life history and quantitative characters. We do not have a well-developed understanding of links between the dynamics of these quantities. 2. Insight into the joint dynamics of populations, quantitative characters and life history can be gained by deriving a model that allows the calculation of fundamental quantities that underpin population ecology, evolutionary biology and life history. The parameterization and analysis of such a model for a specific system can be used to predict how a population will respond to environmental change. 3. Age-stage-structured models can be constructed from character-demography associations that describe age-specific relationships between the character and: (i) survival; (ii) fertility; (iii) ontogenetic development of the character among survivors; and (iv) the distribution of reproductive allocation. 4. These models can be used to calculate a wide range of useful biological quantities including population growth and structure; terms in the Price equation including selection differentials; estimates of biometric heritabilities; and life history descriptors including generation time. We showcase the method through parameterization of a model using data from a well-studied population of Soay sheep Ovis aries. 5. Perturbation analysis is used to investigate how the quantities listed in summary point 4 change as each parameter in each character-demography function is altered. 6. A wide range of joint dynamics of life history, quantitative characters and population growth can be generated in response to changes in different character-demography associations; we argue this explains the diversity of observations on the consequences of environmental change from studies of free-living populations. 7. The approach we describe has the potential to explain within and between species patterns in quantitative characters, life history and population dynamics.},

This is observed not only for long-term evolutionary adaptation, but also in short-term experimental evolution of yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, based on these and other experiments it has been postulated that repeat elements, retroposons for example, mediate such events. We study an evolutionary model in which genomes with retroposons and a breaking/repair mechanism are subjected to a changing environment. We show that retroposon-mediated rearrangements can be a beneficial mutational operator for short-term adaptations to a new environment. But simply having the ability of rearranging chromosomes does not imply an advantage over genomes in which only single-gene insertions and deletions occur. Instead, a structuring of the genome is needed: genes that need to be amplified (or deleted) in a new environment have to cluster. We show that genomes hosting retroposons, starting with a random order of genes, will in the long run become organized, which enables (fast) rearrangement-based adaptations to the environment. In other words, our model provides a "proof of principle" that genomes can structure themselves in order to increase the beneficial effect of chromosome rearrangements.},

In a CA model each cell contains one sinlge molecule at most and empty cells represent the building blocks for new molecules. In the PDE model monomers are used and their concentration included in the equations. Each point can contain several species and activated monomers (building blocks) in different concentrations.

This document uses a PDE model of hypercycles and shows how the spirals created by these are vulnerable to parasites as opposed to those in CA models. The reasons for this are further explored in "Hypercycles Versus Parasites in the Origin of Life."

PDE models are 'well-stirred', i.e., all species are present at each point and this allows homogeneous oscillations. On the other hand, in CA models every point contains only one species at a time and no homogeneous oscillation is observed.

The concentrations of the species oscillate and each time one species dominates while the other have low concentrations (Figure 2). Oscillations occur when the number of species is larger than 4. When the number of species is 3, no oscillation occurs and concentrations remain constant.

During each oscillation all points reach a homogeneous state, i.e., in which all points experience an increase in the concentration of the same species (one for all).

The lattice can be zero-flux or toroidal.

Spirals do not seem to appear from initially homogeneous states. They are only observed from initial states where the lattice is divided in regions with different concentrations or from random states. Different initial conditions lead to different final results but always a stable configuration is reached. Different random states produce different patterns and different divisions of the lattice produce different spirals centered at the point the original divisions met.

The type of boundary used affects directly the evolution of the lattice.

When the polymers are long and require big amounts of monomers, neither the homogeneous state nor the spiral state are stable and a cluster is formed. These clusters consist of regions of high concentrations of polymers completely surrounded by areas of active monomers (building blocks). The size of such clusters is directly proportional to the rate of diffusion used (also a parameter of each simulation).

A parasite can be simulated as the mutation of one molecular species in a hypercycle that receives catalytic support but fails to provide it to other species and thus absorbs the available building blocks. If the rate replication/decay of the parasite is greater than that of the original molecular species then the hypercycle is killed by the parasite after which the parasite also dies. If the rate is equal or less the parasite coexists with the hypercycle or dies without harming it.

In this paper, the parasite is a mutant version of species X1 with a given mutation rate. All sites in the simulation contain some concentration of species X1 and thus a mutant can appear anywhere and no spatial structure can protect a hypercycle from getting killed if its rate of replication/decay is less than that of the parasite.

Experiments were also carried out with a cutoff value (a minimum concentration of a species that is considered as zero) to determine how this parameter may affect the appearance of parasites. In fact when this value is higher it takes longer for a parasite to invade and kill a hypercycle.

When a parasite has a higher diffusion rate than the polymers in a hypercycle, the parasite invades and produces chaotic behaviour in the system where the hypercycle partially survives and reappears periodically.},

annote = {This paper is not cited in my thesis. It has only theoretical interest because its results are not really surprising but they had not been achieved formally yet.

Summary: The author aims to study the interaction between a type of insect and a type of lower. The flower deceives male insects by eliciting sexual behaviour and the hypothesis is that the insects then pay an evolutionary cost if deceived but have an ability to learn to differentiate between the deceitful flower and real females.

The author cites several studies that suggest there must be indeed an evolutionary cost for deceived males and that they exhibit less mating behaviour towards deceitful plants after repeated interactions but that closer examination of those costs or the mechanisms for the apparent learning has not been done yet.

Objective: measure the evolutionary costs and test whether the male insects actually learn to identify fake females or not.

Method: place a dead insect female near an array of deceitful flowering plants. Then bring the males and measure how many males exhibit each type of behaviour (inspection and mating and others). If a male fails to find the female it counts as a missed opportunity. If it does find it then it is recorded as a successful mating. 

Variables measured: time to find the female, number of missed opportunities, probability of finding the female.

With successful/unsuccessful observations a binomial model is created to measure the probability of finding the female (p 2, section b).

By measuring the time each male has left after finding the female they measure the efficiency of males. The number of failures is modleled as a Poisson distribution (p 2, section b).

Learning was measured used a simple but reasonable approach: release inexperienced males into a cage with deceitful flowers and measure their behaviour (mating or feeding) then let them rest (to rule out the possibility that tiredness affects their behaviour later) and then re-release them and measure their behaviour again and use a statistical test (Wilcoxon Matched Paired Test) to compare the figures from the two parts of the experiment.

In addition to the above the mating behaviour of first- and second-timers in the experiment is compared with that of insects who are naturally unfamiliar and familiar with the flowers, respectively.

Unsurpringly the mathematical results show that the time spent attempting to mate with the deceitful flowers does have a repercussion on the insects' mating success.

All the variables observed are affected by varying degrees specially when not considering the behaviour of insects with familiar flower plants. Insects tested only with unfamiliar plants showed a mored defined pattern of behaviour and insects with familiar plants deviate (slightly probably) from the average behaviour of the others.

Understandably insects were more likely to succeed when tested against familiar plants.

Predictably, second-timers significantly showed less mating behaviour towards the deceiving plants than first-timers.

Statistical tests also show that the behaviour of first- and second-timers matches that of wild males that are familiar and unfamiliar with the flowers, which in turn shows that the decrease in mating attempts with the plants is not due to tiredness after repeated experiments because the wild males should not have experience that fatigue.

The author says that if the abilities to learn and deceive are both heritable then antagonistic evolution could occur between the two species (p 5, 2nd column, penultimate and last paragraph).

The author also reasonably says that the evolutionary usefulness of learning must be related to the amount of deceitful flowers relative to the amount of real female insects, and that this conclusion has been confirmed both theoretically and experimentally (page 6, 1st column, first paragraph.). It could be useful to have a look at the two sources cited because that ratio would definitely be important in a hypothetical model of this scenario.

There are several mathematical concepts I'm not familiar with and that I have had to skip over when reading the article for the first time: generalised estimating equation (GEE), logit link function, log link function, QICC and ANOVA.},

Such assumptions may not hold in digital libraries, where users are structured in relatively small groups of experts whose interests may change in unpredictable ways: this is the case of scientific and technical documents archives. Moreover, when recommending documents, users often expect insights on the recommended content as well as a detailed explanation of why the system has selected it, which cannot be provided by collaborative techniques. In this paper we consider the domain of scientific publications repositories and propose a content-based recommender based upon a graph representation of concepts built up by linked keyphrases. This recommender is coupled with a keyphrase extraction system able to generate meaningful metadata for the documents, which are the basis for providing helpful and explainable recommendations.},

Spanning the entire spectrum between the classical, age-structured, Leslie matrix models and continuous- time, physiologically structured population models, it combines the computational case of the matrix models with the flexibility of the continuous-time models: it allows the population dynamics to depend on an arbitrary number of individual characteristics and can account for nonlinear interactions of the population with its (fluctuating) environment, for density dependence in individual behavior, and for a continuous reproduction process. Application of the technique to a model for the dynamics of a Daphnia population reveals that a food-dependent maturation delay induces a very specific type of population cycle, in which the demography of the population plays a major role. The influence of "growth- curve plasticity," that is, the change in size at each age with a change in food density, on individual feeding behavior (at higher food densities individuals are larger and hence eat more) is a potential mechanism to stabilize the dynamics. The influence of growth-curve plasticity on reproduction (primarily the increase in maturation delay with a decrease in food density) greatly destabilizes the system.},

abstract = {We analyze an age-, size- and sex-structured model to investigate how the interplay between individual-level energy budget dynamics and the feedback of population grazing on resources shapes the individual life history and the dynamics of ungulate populations, living in a predator-free, seasonal resource environment. We formulate a dynamic energy budget model for individual energetics, which accounts for energy requirements for maintenance and growth, and possibly pregnancy and lactation. Growth in structural mass is assumed prescribed. Dynamics of energy reserves are the resultant of energy acquisition through grazing and suckling of milk and the aforementioned energy-consuming processes. The dynamic energy budget model is used as the core for an individual-based population model, which captures general features of ungulate life history and population dynamics, although it is parameterized for a particular system. Model predictions reveal a characteristic dynamic pattern, in which years with low death tolls ({\textless}10{\%} of the population dying) alternate with a single year of high death toll (up to 40{\%} of the population dies). In these "collapse" years almost all individuals younger than 2 years die, creating holes in the population age distribution. The die-off of these age classes is shown to be caused by the energy requirements for growth that these individuals face. Individuals between 1 and 2 years of age are more at risk than foals, because they are burdened with the legacy of a poor body condition developed throughout their first winter. The characteristic dynamic pattern is more pronounced at high levels of resource productivity. In contrast, neither a period of snow cover, during which all foraging stops, nor a dependence of fecundity on female body condition change dynamics significantly.},
annote = {fBody size and growth are determinant variables of ungulate population dynamics.

Increased availability of food reduces competition and increases individual growth which in turn increases population. However, the increase in population increases reduces availability of food (and/or other resources) which in turn increases competition and reduces individual growth and survival.

This means that some individual features (e.g., growth, size) are density-dependent, i.e., they vary dependending on the number of individuals in the community.

Individual life history and population dynamics are closely intertwined.

The authors propose a physiologicall structured population model (PSPM) to investigate the relationship between individual life history and population dynamics in ungulates.

The model is general in design but has been parameterised for Konik horses. In the model, individuals are not exposed to predation. Individuals are characterised by their age, size, gender, (in the case of females, whether they are pregnant or lactating).

Resources vary temporally but not spatially. The year is composed of a summer period and a winter period.

Births and deaths are discrete events in time. Growth and foraging are continuous events.},

abstract = {A ubiquitous feature of natural communities is the variation in size that can be observed between organisms, a variation that to a substantial degree is intraspecific. Size variation within species by necessity implies that ecological interactions vary both in intensity and type over the life cycle of an individual. Physiologically structured population models (PSPMs) constitute a modelling approach especially designed to analyse these size-dependent interactions as they explicitly link individual level processes such as consumption and growth to population dynamics. We discuss two cases where PSPMs have been used to analyse the dynamics of size-structured populations. In the first case, a model of a size-structured consumer population feeding on a non-structured prey was successful in predicting both qualitative (mechanisms) and quantitative (individual growth, survival, cycle amplitude) aspects of the population dynamics of a planktivorous fish population. We conclude that single generation cycles as a result of intercohort competition is a general outcome of size-structured consumer-resource interactions. In the second case, involving both cohort competition and cannibalism, we show that PSPMs may predict double asymptotic growth trajectories with individuals ending up as giants. These growth trajectories, which have also been observed in field data, could not be predicted from individual level information, but are emergent properties of the population feedback on individual processes. In contrast to the size-structured consumer-resource model, the dynamics in this case cannot be reduced to simpler lumped stage-based models, but can only be analysed within the domain of PSPMs. Parameter values used in PSPMs adhere to the individual level and are derived independently from the system at focus, whereas model predictions involve both population level processes and individual level processes under conditions of population feedback. This leads to an increased ability to test model predictions but also to a larger set of variables that is predicted at both the individual and population level. The results turn out to be relatively robust to specific model assumptions and thus render a higher degree of generality than purely individual-based models. At the same time, PSPMs offer a much higher degree of realism, precision and testing ability than lumped stage-based or non-structured models. The results of our analyses so far suggest that also in more complex species configurations only a limited set of mechanisms determines the dynamics of PSPMs. We therefore conclude that there is a high potential for developing an individual-based, size-dependent community theory using PSPMs.},

abstract = {We formulate and analyze an archetypal consumer-resource model in terms of ordinary differential equations that consistently translates individual life history processes, in particular food-dependent growth in body size and stage-specific differences between juveniles and adults in resource use and mortality, to the population level. This stage-structured model is derived as an approximation to a physiologically structured population model, which accounts for a complete size-distribution of the consumer population and which is based on assumptions about the energy budget and size-dependent life history of individual consumers. The approximation ensures that under equilibrium conditions predictions of both models are completely identical. In addition we find that under non-equilibrium conditions the stage-structured model gives rise to dynamics that closely approximate the dynamics exhibited by the size-structured model, as long as adult consumers are superior foragers than juveniles with a higher mass-specific ingestion rate. When the mass-specific intake rate of juvenile consumers is higher, the size-structured model exhibits single-generation cycles, in which a single cohort of consumers dominates population dynamics throughout its life time and the population composition varies over time between a dominance by juveniles and adults, respectively. The stage-structured model does not capture these dynamics because it incorporates a distributed time delay between the birth and maturation of an individual organism in contrast to the size-structured model, in which maturation is a discrete event in individual life history. We investigate model dynamics with both semi-chemostat and logistic resource growth. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

part introduces the concept of a chemical organisation as a closed and self-maintaining set of 
components. This concept allows to map a complex (reaction) network to the set of organisations, 
providing a new view on the system's structure. The second part connects dynamics with the set of 
organisations, which allows to map a movement of the system in state space to a movement in the set 
of organisations. The relevancy of our theory is underlined by a theorem that says that given a 
differential equation describing the chemical dynamics of the network, then every stationary state 
is an instance of an organisation. For demonstration, the theory is applied to a small model of 
HIV-immune system interaction by Wodarz and Nowak (Proc. Natl. Acad. USA, 96, 14464-14469) and to a 
large model of the sugar metabolism of E. Coli by Puchalka and Kierzek (Biophys. J., 86, 
1357-1372). In both cases organisations where uncovered, which could be related to functions.},

Valuable formal description of artificial chemistry and incremental description of 
organisations.

The algebra described here only models change in set composition, i.e., how a given set can evolve 
from one composition to another. This excludes (apparently) the study of physical organisation (for 
example, polymerisation).

Numerical chemistries can be designed to be both closed and self-maintaining. But it is unlikely 
that an stoichiometric matrix can be used.


Classical systems analysis assumes a static set of components of the system and offers quantitative 
measures about them and novelty is not taken into account.

abstract = {We develop a systematic toolbox for analyzing the adaptive dynamics of multidimensional traits in physiologically structured population models with point equilibria (sensu Dieckmann et al. in Theor. Popul. Biol. 63:309-338, 2003). Firstly, we show how the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics (Dieckmann and Law in J. Math. Biol. 34:579-612, 1996), an approximation for the rate of evolutionary change in characters under directional selection, can be extended so as to apply to general physiologically structured population models with multiple birth states. Secondly, we show that the invasion fitness function (up to and including second order terms, in the distances of the trait vectors to the singularity) for a community of N coexisting types near an evolutionarily singular point has a rational form, which is model-independent in the following sense: the form depends on the strategies of the residents and the invader, and on the second order partial derivatives of the one-resident fitness function at the singular point. This normal form holds for Lotka-Volterra models as well as for physiologically structured population models with multiple birth states, in discrete as well as continuous time and can thus be considered universal for the evolutionary dynamics in the neighbourhood of singular points. Only in the case of one-dimensional trait spaces or when N = 1 can the normal form be reduced to a Taylor polynomial. Lastly we show, in the form of a stylized recipe, how these results can be combined into a systematic approach for the analysis of the (large) class of evolutionary models that satisfy the above restrictions.},

@article{Eldakar2013,
annote = {(Off note: the author of this paper uses a similar approach to ours in the baldwinian evolution project: determinining analytically the conditions in which an evolutionary result can occur and then confirming it experimentally).

        

        
Alleged result of the paper: selfishness may punish and limit other types of selfishness thus maintaining altruism in the population. When selfish punishment is introduced first it can later mutate to altruistic punishment and stabilise.

        
Previous research: "Punishers are often revered" and "experience greater rewards and favour by those group members in which they protect" (page 2, highlighted).

        
Previous research: "How punishers prevail when facing exploitation from nonpunishers" (page 2, highlighted).

        
Previous research: Cooperation and punishment of noncooperation have a negative correlation (page 2, highlighted).

        
The model is based on a "public goods game" (game where participants secretly contribute to public goods and these are divided evenly among all). All invidivuals form groups randomly. Altruists contribute all their resources and the selfish do not contribute at all. Fitness is measured as the number of resources an individual has after repartition. Individual fitness is increased by selfishness but group fitness is increased by altruism (page 3).

        
Punishers, both altruist and selfish, pay a cost, while punishment results in expulsion of cheaters. The probability of a selfish cheater getting caught by an individual punisher is equal for all (D) and the overall probability of getting caught depends on the number of punishers in the group (page 3). Punishment occurs randomly with the overall probability. Those punished are replaced with other individuals from the pool (page 3).

        
There are four groups (page 4):

        
Altruistic nonpunishers.
Selfish nonpunishers.
Altruistic punishers.
Selfish punishers.

        
Altruistic individuals always contribute to the common goods, whereas selfish individuals always keep their resources to themselves. Punishers detect cheaters with certain probability and banish them from their group.

        
Each simulation is done with one type of punisher: altruistic or selfish. With altruistic punishers both these and altruistic nonpunishers outcompete selfish individuals. With selfish punishers, altruisitic nonpunishers outcompete selfish nonpunishers. Conclusion: altruistic nonpunishers outcompete selfish individuals (punishers or not) when there{\&}{\#}039;s punishing by either altruisitc or selfish individuals (page 5).

        
Selfish punishment is more likely to succeed than altruisitic punishment (Figure 4, page 6).

        
Under baseline conditions, e.g., initial 22{\%} altruists and 10{\%} punishment, altruists and (selfish) punishers coexist and outcompete selfish non-punishers. If mutation from selfish to altruistic punishment is allowed, altruistic punishment successfully emerges and altruism "is established and maintained at {\textgreater} 99{\%}". Otherwise altruistic punishment alone cannot achieve the same result under the same circumstances (Figure 5, page 6).

        
Selfish punishers perform better than altrusitic punishers because the former pay a "reduced relative cost of punishment" given that they also cheat and take advantage of others, which the altrustic obviously do not. When the cost of punishing others increases punishers are less likely to outcompete others, when the cost becomes low the advantage of selfish punishers over their altruistic counterparts is unsurprinsingly reduced. Main conclusion of this point: when the cost of policing is more or less high (not too high not too low) it is more advantageous to selfish punishers than to altruisitic punishers (page 7, "COST OF PUNISHMENT", Figure 6).

        
Banished individuals receive resources each iteration. When these resources less abundant, punishment is more effective (page 8, figure 7). Varying other parameters of the simulation, like the number of iterations or the size of group, shows an effect on the performance of punishers and altruists in general, but overall the best results for these two broad groups occur when selfish punishment is introduced.

        
General conclusion: most plots show that the area of initial conditions that lead success of selfish punishers is always larger than that of altrusitic punishers, i.e., selfish punishers are more successful in the general case. Moreover selfish punishment can offer a way (seemingly the only one), via mutation, for altruisitc punishment to emerge and succeed.

        
Another conclusion: altruism should be favoured in between-group competition whereas selfishness is favoured in within-group competition. If selfish individuals stay long in a group, they suffer the consequences of the low performance of that group (page 10).

abstract = {Matrix projection models occupy a central role in population and conservation biology. Matrix models divide a population into discrete classes, even if the structuring trait exhibits continuous variation (e.g., body size). The integral projection model (IPM) avoids discrete classes and potential artifacts from arbitrary class divisions, facilitates parsimonious modeling based on smooth relationships between individual state and demographic performance, and can be implemented with standard matrix software. Here, we extend the IPM to species with complex demographic attributes, including dormant and active life stages, cross-classification by several attributes (e.g., size, age, and condition), and changes between discrete and continuous structure over the life cycle. We present a general model encompassing these cases, numerical methods, and theoretical results, including stable population growth and sensitivity/elasticity analysis for density-independent models, local stability analysis in density-dependent models, and optimal/evolutionarily stable strategy life-history analysis. Our presentation centers on an IPM for the thistle Onopordum illyricum based on a 6-year field study. Flowering and death probabilities are size and age dependent, and individuals also vary in a latent attribute affecting survival, but a predictively accurate IPM is completely parameterized by fitting a few regression equations. The online edition of the American Naturalist includes a zip archive of R scripts illustrating our suggested methods.A zip archive of R scripts illustrating our suggested methods is also provided.},

annote = {Different species exhibit different levels of specialisation. There are species whose members exhibit irreversible specialisation at early life stages (e.g., bees). There are others where this specialisation is not irreversible or early. Other species are located in the continuum between these two extremes.

The individual's choice to become either a specialised 'breeder' or 'helper' should depend on the information available.

When monogamy is prevalent in a species, individuals are more likely to be born in the company of relatives (siblings, parents, cousins, etc). This information could be imprinted genetically into the individual who is deciding whether to become a breeder or a helper.

Cooperative breeding is mostly observed in species where females are able to have multiple offspring.

The individual making its decision (to become either a breeder or a helper) can also take cues from the environment, including its parents. Some termites species determine whether to leave the nest and stay depending on environment cues predicting the availability of resources and the probability of inheriting a breeder position in the nest.

If there are substantian morphological differences between breeder and helper strategies then early specialisation is more likely.},

We establish existence and positivity of solutions by showing that solutions are governed by a positive quasicontractive semigroup of linear operators on the biologically relevant state space. These results are obtained by establishing dissipativity of a suitably perturbed semigroup generator. We also show that solutions of the model exhibit balanced exponential growth, that is, our model admits a finite-dimensional global attractor.

abstract = {Most research in biology is empirical, yet empirical studies rely fundamentally on theoretical work for generating testable predictions and interpreting observations. Despite this interdependence, many empirical studies build largely on other empirical studies with little direct reference to relevant theory, suggesting a failure of communication that may hinder scientific progress. To investigate the extent of this problem, we analyzed how the use of mathematical equations affects the scientific impact of studies in ecology and evolution. The density of equations in an article has a significant negative impact on citation rates, with papers receiving 28{\%} fewer citations overall for each additional equation per page in the main text. Long, equation-dense papers tend to be more frequently cited by other theoretical papers, but this increase is outweighed by a sharp drop in citations from nontheoretical papers (35{\%} fewer citations for each additional equation per page in the main text). In contrast, equations presented in an accompanying appendix do not lessen a paper's impact. Our analysis suggests possible strategies for enhancing the presentation of mathematical models to facilitate progress in disciplines that rely on the tight integration of theoretical and empirical work.},

abstract = {We propose that chemical evolution can take place by natural selection if a geophysical process is capable of heterotrophic formation of liposomes that grow at some base rate, divide by external agitation, and are subject to stochastic chemical avalanches, in the absence of nucleotides or any monomers capable of modular heredity. We model this process using a simple hill-climbing algorithm, and an artificial chemistry that is unique in exhibiting conservation of mass and energy in an open thermodynamic system. Selection at the liposome level results in the stabilization of rarely occurring molecular autocatalysts that either catalyse or are consumed in reactions that confer liposome level fitness; typically they contribute in parallel to an increasingly conserved intermediary metabolism. Loss of competing autocatalysts can sometimes be adaptive. Steady-state energy flux by the individual increases due to the energetic demands of growth, but also of memory, i.e. maintaining variations in the chemical network. Self-organizing principles such as those proposed by Kauffman, Fontana, and Morowitz have been hypothesized as an ordering principle in chemical evolution, rather than chemical evolution by natural selection. We reject those notions as either logically flawed or at best insufficient in the absence of natural selection. Finally, a finite population model without elitism shows the practical evolutionary constraints for achieving chemical evolution by natural selection in the lab.},

First, natural selection may favor risky strategies that enhance fitness on average but which have detrimental consequences for a subset of individuals. Second, mismatch may result when organisms experience environmental change during ontogeny, for instance, because they move from one environment to another. Third, organisms may learn about their environment in order to develop an appropriate phenotype; when cues indicate the environmental state probabilistically, as opposed to deterministically, sampling processes may produce mismatch. For each source of maladaptation, we present a selection of the relevant empirical research and illustrate how models from evolutionary biology can be used to make predictions about maladaptation. We also discuss what data can be collected to test these models in humans. Our goal is to show that evolutionary approaches not only yield insights into adaptive outcomes but can also illuminate the conditions leading to maladaptation. This perspective provides additional nuance to the dialectic between the developmental psychopathology model and evolutionary developmental psychology.},

abstract = {Development is typically a constructive process, in which phenotypes incrementally adapt to local ecologies. Here, we present a novel model in which natural selection shapes developmental systems based on the evolutionary ecology, and these systems adaptively guide phenotypic development. We assume that phenotypic construction is incremental and trades off with sampling cues to the environmental state. We computed the optimal developmental programmes across a range of evolutionary ecological conditions. Using these programmes, we simulated distributions of mature phenotypes. Our results show that organisms sample the environment most extensively when cues are moderately, not highly, informative. When the developmental programme relies heavily on sampling, individuals transition from sampling to specialization at different times in ontogeny, depending on the consistency of their sampled cue set; this finding suggests that stochastic sampling may result in individual differences in plasticity itself. In addition, we find that different selection pressures may favour similar developmental mechanisms, and that organisms may incorrectly calibrate development despite stable ontogenetic environments. We hope our model will stimulate adaptationist research on the constructive processes guiding development.},
annote = {The authors present a model of the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.

Individuals may live in one of two environments: 1 or 0. Phenotypes can be either: 1 or 0. Matching between phenotype and environment determines the fitness of the individual.

The lifetime of the individual is composed of 20 discrete steps. In each step one of two actions is performed: sampling or specialising.

With sampling the individual gains noisy information regarding the environment it lives in. By specialising the individual modifies its phenotype according to its current belief. The two tasks are mutually exclusive in each life step.

The las two of the three methods to measure fitness are unclear to me (pag 3559, column 2, paragraph 2, highlighted). Why in 'diminishing returns' the fitness decreases with each step towards the correct environment assumption? What does the third one mean?

Results: If cues are moderately or highly informative then individuals evolve plasticity. When validities (the probability that the cue is truthful) are intermediate then the greatest reliance on sampling is observed. When cues are weakly informative then more sampling is required by each individual.

Plasticity decreases as one environment becomes more likely than the other (obvioulsy). Plasticity increases as cue validity increases.},

abstract = {Interactions between evolutionary psychologists and developmental systems theorists have been largely antagonistic. This is unfortunate because potential synergies between the two approaches remain unexplored. This article presents a method that may help to bridge the divide, and that has proven fruitful in biology: dynamic optimization. Dynamic optimization integrates developmental systems theorists' focus on dynamics and contingency with the 'design stance' of evolutionary psychology. It provides a theoretical framework as well as a set of tools for exploring the properties of developmental systems that natural selection might favor, given particular evolutionary ecologies. We also discuss limitations of the approach.},
annote = {The objective of the authors is:

1. Show how dynamic optimization can be used to model development.

2. Show hos the study of developmental systemas and evolutionary systems can be bridged.

The authors refer to the debate between two groups of researchers: evolutionary psychologists and developmental theorists.

In spatial variation the individual type with the greatest arithmetic mean is the most successful.

In temporal variation the individual type with the greatest geometric mean is the most successful.

Spatial and temporal variation measure fitness in different ways and therefore they lead to different adaptations.

Dynamic optimization: expand the tree of the outcomes of all possible strategies and traverse in reverse prunning non-optimal branches.

In a simple example an animal undergoes three life steps. In each of these the individual can either grow (which increases the survival probability of future offspring) or reproduce. The dynamic optimization method shows that the optimal choice is either grow in the first step and reproduce twice, or simple reproduce three times.

The authors state as a disadvantage fof the model the fact that the individual 'knows' the values of s (probability of mother's survival) and c (death rate of offspring).

Adaptive dynamic optimization: One example presented is that of an organism that lives in a stable environment but whose parents lived in an unstable one. The individual has inherited mechanisms to gather cues from the environment in order to estimate its state and take action, by developing an appropriate phenotype, for instance. The authors then mention the trade-off between early development and investment in cue sampling.},

abstract = {As information is available in abundance for every topic on internet, condensing the important information in the form of summary would benefit a number of users. Hence, there is growing interest among the research community for developing new approaches to automatically summarize the text. Automatic text summarization system generates a sum- mary, i.e. short length text that includes all the important information of the document. Since the advent of text summarization in 1950s, researchers have been trying to improve techniques for generating summaries so that machine generated summary matches with the human made summary. Summary can be generated through extractive as well as abstractive methods. Abstractive methods are highly complex as they need extensive natural language processing. Therefore, research community is focusing more on extractive summaries, try- ing to achieve more coherent andmeaningful summaries.During a decade, several extractive approaches have been developed for automatic summary generation that implements a num- ber of machine learning and optimization techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent text summarization extractive approaches developed in the last decade. Their needs are identified and their advantages and disadvantages are listed in a comparative manner.Afewabstractive and multilingual text summarization approaches are also covered.Summary evaluation is another challenging issue in this research field. Therefore, intrinsic as well as extrinsic both the methods of summary evaluation are described in detail along with text summarization evaluation conferences and workshops. Furthermore, evaluation results of extractive summarization approaches are presented on some sharedDUCdatasets. Finally this paper concludes with the discussion of useful future directions that can help researchers to identify areas where further research is needed. B},

abstract = {Adaptive radiation is defined as the evolution of ecological and phenotypic diversity within a rapidly multiplying lineage. When it occurs, adaptive radiation typically follows the colonization of a new environment or the establishment of a "key innovation," which opens new ecological niches and/or new paths for evolution. Here, we take advantage of recent developments in speciation theory and modern computing power to build and explore a large-scale, stochastic, spatially explicit, individual-based model of adaptive radiation driven by adaptation to multidimensional ecological niches. We are able to model evolutionary dynamics of populations with hundreds of thousands of sexual diploid individuals over a time span of 100,000 generations assuming realistic mutation rates and allowing for genetic variation in a large number of both selected and neutral loci. Our results provide theoretical support and explanation for a number of empirical patterns including "area effect," "overshooting effect," and "least action effect," as well as for the idea of a "porous genome." Our findings suggest that the genetic architecture of traits involved in the most spectacular radiations might be rather simple. We show that a great majority of speciation events are concentrated early in the phylogeny. Our results emphasize the importance of ecological opportunity and genetic constraints in controlling the dynamics of adaptive radiation.},

abstract = {Early experience has a particularly great effect on most organisms. Normal development may be disrupted by early environmental influences; individuals that survive have to cope with the damaging consequences. Additionally, the responses required to cope with environmental challenges in early life may have long-term effects on the adult organism. A further set of processes, those of developmental plasticity, may induce a phenotype that is adapted to the adult environment predicted by the conditions of early life. A mismatch between prediction and subsequent reality can cause severe health problems in those human societies where economic circumstances and nutrition are rapidly improving. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of plasticity is, therefore, clinically important. However, to conduct research in this area, developmental plasticity must be disentangled from disruption and the adverse long-term effects of coping. The paper reviews these concepts and explores ways in which such distinctions may be made in practice.},

Making use of Wright's Coefficient of Relationship as the measure of the proportion of replica genes in a relative, a quantity is found which incorporates the maximizing property of Darwinian fitness. This quantity is named “inclusive fitness”. Species following the model should tend to evolve behaviour such that each organism appears to be attempting to maximize its inclusive fitness. This implies a limited restraint on selfish competitive behaviour and possibility of limited self-sacrifices. Special cases of the model are used to show (a) that selection in the social situations newly covered tends to be slower than classical selection, (b) how in populations of rather non-dispersive organisms the model may apply to genes affecting dispersion, and (c) how it may apply approximately to competition between relatives, for example, within sibships.

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is one major source of variation in natural populations. Inducible defences, which can be considered threshold traits, are a form of plasticity that generates ecological and evolutionary consequences. A simple cost-benefit model underpins the maintenance and evolution of these threshold, inducible traits. In this model, a rank-order switch in expected fitness, defined by costs and benefits of induction between defended and undefended morphs, predicts the risk level at which individuals should induce defences. Here, taking predator-induced morphological defences in Daphnia pulex as a threshold trait, we provide the first comprehensive investigation into the costs and benefits of a threshold trait, and how they combine to reflect fitness and predict the switchpoint at which induction should occur. We develop reaction norms that show genetic variation in switchpoints. Further experiments show that induction can confer a survival benefit and a cost in terms of lifetime reproductive success. Together, these two traits combine to estimate expected fitness and can predict the switchpoint between an undefended and a defended strategy. The predictions match the reaction norm data for clones that experience these costs and benefits, and correspond well to independent field data on induction. However, predictions do not, and cannot, match for clones that do not gain a benefit from induction. This study confirms that a simple theory, based on life history costs and benefits, is a sufficient framework for understanding the ecology and evolution of inducible, threshold traits.},
annote = {The article aims to answer the following question: given two morphologies, defended and undefended, and varying levels of induced reactivity, what are the threshold conditions for which it is more evolutionarily stable to switch to a more sensitive induced strategy (i.e., defend only when exposed to the appropriate stimuli)?

The conditions include costs and benefits of induction as well as the mortality risk involved.

The switchpoint in terms of risk is where the fitness of both strategies are equal.

The authors present a model to predict this and to compare the predictions with experimental data.

Experimentally, the water fleas are exposed to stimuli from the predators and their reaction (development of pedestals and spikes) is measured for each concentration of predators.

Reaction norms ({\%} induction vs cue concentration) are taken.



The model shows the following:

1. There is genetic variation in the level of induction.
2. The defences indeed improve the individual's survival against predators.
3. Inducement of the defences (caused by exposure to predator cues) significantly decreases the individual's lifetime reproductive success (LRS).
4. The threshold transition from undefended to defenced can be predicted by measuring fitness as the product of survival and LRS.

Two clones were tested: cyril and colin.

The model predicts that cyril individuals should evolve to induce even when predator density is low and the experimental data agree with this prediction.

The model predicts that colin individuals should evolve to never induce in any of the experimental predator densities considered. The model shows that these individuals require predator densities as high as 100 times the density observed in the ponds the authors sampled. The reason for this is that in colin individuals induction results in increased mortality and unchanged reproductive rate. The authors explain that as long as inducement of the defences leads to reduced life expectanct the model can not make sensible predictions.

the authors argue that even though colin individuals might fail in induce when exposed to cues from Chaoborus, their small size might allow them to survive.

The low induction in colin is explained by the authors as follows. In their study, they have found out that fitness for both morphs (defended and undefended) is uniformly low and the difference in fitness between the two is very small. Therefore the defences do not offer a significant benefit in terms of fitness and colin individuals should have evolved low sensitivity to Cahoborus in order to avoid the costs incurred into when inducing the defences.},

abstract = {To identify sources of inter-subject variation in vaccine responses, we performed high-frequency sampling of human peripheral blood cells post-vaccination, followed by a novel systems biology analysis. Functional principal component analysis was used to examine time varying B cell vaccine responses. In subjects vaccinated within the previous three years, 90{\%} of transcriptome variation was explained by a single subject-specific mathematical pattern. Within individual vaccine response patterns, a common subset of 742 genes was strongly correlated with migrating plasma cells. Of these, 366 genes were associated with human plasmablasts differentiating in vitro. Additionally, subject-specific temporal transcriptome patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells identified migration of myeloid/dendritic cell lineage cells one day after vaccination. Upstream analyses of transcriptome changes suggested both shared and subject-specific transcription groups underlying larger patterns. With robust statistical methods, time-varying response characteristics of individual subjects were effectively captured along with a shared plasma cell gene signature.},

network theory and in a network model that resolves the I-J paradox. It proposes that co-selection 
of helper T cells and HIV variants plays a role in the pathogenesis of AIDS. The AIDS model 
involves a role for the T cell receptor in the infection of T cells. Finally, a way in which a 
co-selection process may potentially be used in the prevention and therapy of harmful forms of

On the one hand we look at spatially explicit models of replicators in which, by a process of self-organization, new levels of selection arise as large scale spatial patterns with a dynamics of their own. Alternatively externally imposed levels of selection above the basic replicators are created by enclosing the replicators in vesicles. In this paper we first review some results on the impact of emerging higher levels of selection on the evolutionary persistence of interacting co-evolving replicator systems. Moreover, we present a vesicle model, which can potentially integrate emerging and imposed levels of selection. We use the models to examine the classical problem information integration in early evolution.},

Despite differences between various proposed scenarios, one common element seems to be the emergence of an autocatalytic set or cycle at some stage. However, there is still disagreement as to how likely it is that such self-sustaining sets could arise ``spontaneously''. This disagreement is largely caused by the lack of formal models. Here, we briefly review some of the criticism against and evidence in favor of autocatalytic sets, and then make a case for their plausibility based on a formal framework that was introduced and studied in our previous work.},

Cited by Fernando in (2012) "Evolution Before Genes."

It has previously been argued that in a sufficiently complex system, an autocatalytic set will 
emerge spontaneuosly. The objective of this paper is to provide a formal way to determine the 
probability that an autocatalytic set may emerge in a particular chemical network and an algorithm 
to find it.

Two competing (more or less) theories: RNA first and protein first. It is unlikely that RNA emerged 
alone since replication without catalysis is hard and unlikely. Proteins on the other hand lack 
template structure. Idea: at some point both types of molecules coexisted (instead of one appearing 
before the other) in a chemical network.

This paper's definition of autocatalysis is different from other publications. It is defined as an 
attribute of a set of reactions instead of a set of molecules.

In this paper's definition, a set of reactions is autocatalytic if each reaction is catalysed by a 
molecule present in the other reactions and all reactants can be produced from the food set with 
repeated application of reactions within the same set.

An algorithm is provided and tested in the particular case of Kauffman's model.

The algorithm is based on two different reductions of a catalytic reaction system.

1. Reduction to RA: keeping only reactions that are catalysed by species that also appear as 
non-catalysts in other reactions.

2. Reduction to F-generated: keep only reactions whose reactants belong to the closure of the food 
set, i.e., reactants that can be produced directly or indirectly from the food set.

Iterative, sequential application of both reductions results in a RAF set. This iterative process 
is the body of the algorithm proposed in this document.

At the time of reading this paper I'm working on ways to formalise the search of hypercycles in the 
numerical artificial chemistry. My conclusion is that the only similarity is the first reduction 
(reduction to RA) since the numerical chemistry does not use a food set.

Fernando mentions results of this paper where the hypothesis that when the probability of catalysis 
of molecules (the probability that a molecule is able to catalyse any given reaction) reaches some 
threshold, a chain reaction is triggered and due to catalytic closure autocatalytic sets appear. 
They tested this claim by generating random networks of reversible ligation/cleavage reactions 
between molecules of length up 20 where each had a probability P of catalysing a reaction.

abstract = {We review the use of the terms 'optimism' and 'pessimism' to characterize particular types of behaviour in non-human animals. Animals can certainly behave as though they are optimistic or pessimistic with respect to specific motivations, as documented by an extensive range of examples in the literature. However, in surveying such examples we find that these terms are often poorly defined and are liable to lead to confusion. Furthermore, when considering behaviour within the framework of optimal decision theory using appropriate currencies, it is often misleading to describe animals as optimistic or pessimistic. There are two common misunderstandings. First, some apparent cases of biased behaviour result from misidentifying the currencies and pay-offs the animals should be maximising. Second, actions that do not maximise short-term pay-offs have sometimes been described as optimistic or pessimistic when in fact they are optimal in the long term; we show how such situations can be understood from the perspective of bandit models. Rather than describing suboptimal, unrealistic behaviour, the terms optimism and pessimism are better restricted to informal usage. Our review highlights the importance of choosing the relevant currency when attempting to predict the action of natural selection.},

We show how artificial chemistries such as this one can be implemented as a cellular automaton. We concur with Dittrich, Ziegler, and Banzhaf that artificial chemistries are a good medium in which to study early evolution.},
annote = {This paper proposes a set of reactions in a "Hutton chemistry" in which self-replicating molecules can emerge under a given set of conditions. The replicators carry a DNA-like sequence of atoms that, even though not critical for replication, do influence the molecule's environment. This could potentially make a difference when it comes to evolutionary fitness. 

There are three ways to produce self-replication. CA, computer viruses and natural chemistry. Artificial chemistries represent a fourth medium to explore.

The reactions are such that any string of a1's, b1's, c1's, and d1's with an e8 at one end and an f1 at the other will replicate when immersed in a sufficiently large random soup of atoms in state 0.

The set of reactions is intended to lead to open-ended evolution producing increasing complexity. But selective pressure so far results in shorter molecules.

First experiment starts with a single strand (already constructed) and enough raw material in the environment for the starting molecule to replicate. After a few time cycles, the surface is domiated by copies of the original molecule, some of them imperfect copies (halfway throgh complete replication and separation) after required resources have been exhausted by the other copies. One "problem" is that sometimes molecules in the process of replication may mistakenly bond with each other creating a larger molecule that is not able to replicate or that, after division, produces two or more daughters different from the original two parent molecules, like a rudimentary crossover.

Second experiment consists of apllying "floods" on certain areas every certain periods of time, these floods simply remove all molecules and replace them with new, raw atoms in state zero. Selective pressure thus favours molecules that replicate quickly, i.e. shorter molecules., because these are the ones that manage to spread over all the area used in the simulation. As a result, over a few generations the population is dominated by short molecules but evolution does not go further (for example, molecules predating others).

Third experiment shows how replicators may appear spontaneously. Simulation starts only with random atoms in state zero. Eah atom has a probability of having its state mutated. After a few thousand generations atoms change state and some of the original reaction rules become applicable allowing the right atoms to eventually encounter each other and bond together forming molecules. After a few more thousand generations one of these molecules has the right structure for replication and in a few generations the whole world is dominated by copies of the first successful replicator.},

Partly this is due to its enormous size, but we have also identified four problems with the original specification that would prevent it from working. These problems potentially cast doubt on Codd's central assertion, that the eight-state space he presents supports the existence of machines that can act as universal constructors and computers. However, all these problems were found to be correctable, and we present a complete and functioning implementation after making minor changes to the design and transition table. The body of the final machine occupies an area that is 22,254 cells wide and 55,601 cells high, composed of over 45 million nonzero cells in its unsheathed form. The data tape is 208 million cells long, and self-replication is estimated to take at least 1.7 x 10(18) time steps.},

I'm not sure the results of this paper are impressive. If selection is being forced to favour a certain type of interaction between nodes it seems just unremarkable that precisely that kind of interaction emerges. The process consists of selecting the "least fit" and making it mutate randomly each time step. This seems more like a random search to me.




Fitness is defined in terms of values derived from the set of species and connection matrix. The derivation is a little bit complicated but the overall logic is clear: at all moments determine which nodes are the least fit and then mutate them. Groups of fit nodes may eventually form an ACS (autocatalytic set). Mutation does not destroy the ACS because it acts only on unfit species that by definition can not be in the ACS. Given enough time, mutation of unfit species eventually allows the ACS to grow and control the whole network of species.

abstract = {Confidence is an essential ingredient of success in a wide range of domains ranging from job performance and mental health to sports, business and combat. Some authors have suggested that not just confidence but overconfidence--believing you are better than you are in reality--is advantageous because it serves to increase ambition, morale, resolve, persistence or the credibility of bluffing, generating a self-fulfilling prophecy in which exaggerated confidence actually increases the probability of success. However, overconfidence also leads to faulty assessments, unrealistic expectations and hazardous decisions, so it remains a puzzle how such a false belief could evolve or remain stable in a population of competing strategies that include accurate, unbiased beliefs. Here we present an evolutionary model showing that, counterintuitively, overconfidence maximizes individual fitness and populations tend to become overconfident, as long as benefits from contested resources are sufficiently large compared with the cost of competition. In contrast, unbiased strategies are only stable under limited conditions. The fact that overconfident populations are evolutionarily stable in a wide range of environments may help to explain why overconfidence remains prevalent today, even if it contributes to hubris, market bubbles, financial collapses, policy failures, disasters and costly wars.},

This is done by estimating the expected fitness of the population and the invader, if the expected fitness of the invader is greater than that of the population, then the invader is assumed to succeed.

The mathematical model is rather straight-forward, but for each situation in becomes tedious. For each set of parameters (v,k) the probabilities Pw, Pl, Po (winning, losing, and acquiring qithout conflict) can be deduced only after a long algebraic exercise. These values in turn allow to calculate the expected fitness of both a population and a potential invader. By comparing these one can conclude whether or not the invader succeeds.

abstract = {A significant part of eukaryotic noncoding DNA is viewed as the passive result of mutational processes, such as the proliferation of mobile elements. However, sequences lacking an immediate utility can nonetheless play a major role in the long-term evolvability of a lineage, for instance by promoting genomic rearrangements. They could thus be subject to an indirect selection. Yet, such a long-term effect is difficult to isolate either in vivo or in vitro. Here, by performing in silico experimental evolution, we demonstrate that, under low mutation rates, the indirect selection of variability promotes the accumulation of noncoding sequences: Even in the absence of self-replicating elements and mutational bias, noncoding sequences constituted an important fraction of the evolved genome because the indirectly selected genomes were those that were variable enough to discover beneficial mutations. On the other hand, high mutation rates lead to compact genomes, much like the viral ones, although no selective cost of genome size was applied: The indirectly selected genomes were those that were small enough for the genetic information to be reliably transmitted. Thus, the spontaneous evolution of the amount of noncoding DNA strongly depends on the mutation rate. Our results suggest the existence of an additional pressure on the amount of noncoding DNA, namely the indirect selection of an appropriate trade-off between the fidelity of the transmission of the genetic information and the exploration of the mutational neighborhood. Interestingly, this trade-off resulted robustly in the accumulation of noncoding DNA so that the best individual leaves one offspring without mutation (or only neutral ones) per generation.},

annote = {How to measure complexity?

Does evolution result in an indefinite increase of complexity? It's a reasonable assumption when evolving parties influence each other to some degree leading to arms races. The environment is also subject to change and, probably, to evolution.

There are at least two different levels of biological organisation whose complexity is of interest: the organism and the biosystem. Focus is preffered on the latter since, theoretically, passive diffusion is capable of accounting for the former.

Theoretical Entropy as a measure of the number of bits required to identify a state as the current state of a systems. And complexity and entropy share a relationship that is not just of simple opposites. 

Two direct phenomena in evidence of Strong AOC.

Major Transitions: massive reorganisation of the evolutionary system.
Mass extinctions and adaptive radiation: when extinction occurs surviving population has a lot of free resources to utilise and begin to propagate and radiate.

The authors propose the use of niches to measure biosystemic complexity.},

abstract = {Evidence that fetal nutrition triggers permanent adjustments in a wide range of systems and health outcomes is stimulating interest in the evolutionary significance of these responses. This review evaluates the postnatal adaptive significance of fetal developmental plasticity from the perspective of life history theory and evolutionary models of energy partitioning. Birthweight is positively related to multiple metabolically costly postnatal functions, suggesting that the fetus has the capacity to distribute the burden of energy insufficiency when faced with a nutritionally challenging environment. Lowering total requirements may reduce the risk of negative energy balance, which disproportionately impacts functions that are not essential for survival but that are crucial for reproductive success. The long-term benefit of these metabolic adjustments is contingent upon the fetus having access to a cue that is predictive of its future nutritional environment, a problem complicated in a long-lived species by short-term ecologic fluctuations like seasonality. Evidence is reviewed suggesting that the flow of nutrients reaching the fetus provides an integrated signal of nutrition as experienced by recent matrilineal ancestors, which effectively limits the responsiveness to short-term ecologic fluctuations during any given pregnancy. This capacity for fetal nutrition to minimize the growth response to transient ecologic fluctuations is defined here as intergenerational "phenotypic inertia," and is hypothesized to allow the fetus to cut through the "noise" of seasonal or other stochastic influences to read the "signal" of longer-term ecologic trends. As a mode of adaptation, phenotypic inertia may help the organism cope with ecologic trends too gradual to be tracked by conventional developmental plasticity, but too rapid to be tracked by natural selection. From an applied perspective, if a trait like fetal growth is designed to minimize the effects of short-term fluctuations by integrating information across generations, public health interventions may be most effective if focused not on the individual but on the matriline.},

At the time of reading this paper I'm looking to formalise the problem of finding hypercycles in a chemistry (M,R) which so far seems to be a computationally hard problem. The objective of this paper is not exactly the same. The author tries to "construct" hypercycles given a population of strands (whose catalysation rules are mutated) whereas the original problem I'm working on is how to find hypercycles in a static algebraic chemistry (M,R).

This paper uses a simplified version of typogenetics and states that exhaustive (evolutionary) construction of hypercycles is a very hard combinatorial problem. The author presents then a second evolutionary algorithm where hypercycles are constructed with an incremental approach.

The typogenetics used include a more-or-less faithful representation of double-stranded DNA strands (with bases and everything). Two mappings are applied to each strand (instruction and inclination) that represent the action of an enzyme over the original strand.

When the twice-repeated action of an enzyme results in production of the original strand, the strand is called an autoreplicator.

Autoreplicators are constructed with an evolutionary algorithm where fitness measures the ability of a strand to replicate. A population of strands is initialised randomly and each generation individuals are selected based on fitness and reproduce by mutation.

Hypercycles are constructed with an almost identical evolutionary algorithm. A population of potential hypercycles (each one a group of strands) is initialised. Fitness measures the ability of the potential hypercycle to replicate. Selection is based on fitness and replication is made with mutation. Results were successful with hypercycles composed of only two replicators. Hypercycles of larger sizes never succeeded. The author concludes that an "... emergence of hypercycles composed of more than two autoreplicators is a very improbable evolutionary event"},

Class B gene function requires transcriptional upregulation by an autoregulatory loop that depends on obligate heterodimerization of DEF-like and GLO-like proteins. Because switch-like behavior of gene expression can be displayed by single genes already, the functional relevance of this complex circuitry has remained enigmatic. On the basis of a stochastic in silico model of class B gene and protein interactions, we suggest that obligate heterodimerization of class B floral homeotic proteins is not simply the result of neutral drift but enhanced the robustness of cell-fate organ identity decisions in the presence of stochastic noise. This finding strongly corroborates the view that the appearance of this regulatory mechanism during angiosperm phylogeny led to a canalization of flower development and evolution.},

abstract = {Theories of the origin of life have proposed hypotheses to link inanimate to animate matter. The theory proposed here derived the crucial stages in the origin of animate matter directly from the basic properties of inanimate matter. It asked what were the general characteristics of the link, rather than what might have been its chemical details. Life and its origin are shown to be one continuous physicochemical process of replication, random variation, and natural selection. Since life exists here and now, animate properties must have been initiated in the past somewhere. According to the theory, life originated from an as yet unknown elementary autocatalyst which occurred spontaneously, then replicated autocatalytically. As it multiplied to macroscopic abundance, its replicas gradually exhausted their reactants. Random chemical drift initiated diversity among autocatalysts. Diversity led to competition. Competition and depletion of reactants slowed down the rates of net replication of the autocatalysts. Some reached negative rates and became extinct, while those which stayed positive "survived." Thus chemical natural selection appeared, the first step in the transition from inanimate to animate matter. It initiated the first animate property, fitness, i.e., the capacity to adapt to the environment and to survive. As the environment was depleted of reactants, it was enriched with sequels-namely, with decomposition products and all other products which accompany autocatalysis. The changing environment exerted a selective pressure on autocatalysts to replace dwindling reactants by accumulating sequels. Sequels that were incorporated into the autocatalytic process became internal components of complex autocatalytic systems. Primitive forms of metabolism and organization were thus initiated. They evolved further by the same mechanism to ever higher levels of complexity, such as homochirality (handedness) and membranal enclosure. Subsequent evolution by the same mechanism generated cellular metabolism, cell division, information carriers, and a genetic code. Theories of self-organization without natural selection are refuted.},

abstract = {Spatial self-structuring has been a focus of recent interest among evolutionary ecologists. We review recent developments in the study of the interplay between spatial self-structuring and evolution. We first discuss the relative merits of the various theoretical approaches to spatial modelling in ecology. Second, we synthesize the main theoretical studies of the evolution of cooperation in spatially structured populations. We show that population viscosity is generally beneficial to cooperation, because cooperators can reap additional benefits from being clustered. A similar mechanism can explain the evolution of honest communication and of reduced virulence in host-parasite interactions. We also discuss some recent innovative empirical results that test these theories. Third, we show the relevance of these results to the general field of evolutionary ecology. An important conclusion is that kin selection is the main process that drives evolution of cooperation in viscous populations. Many results of kin selection theory can be recovered as emergent properties of spatial ecological dynamics. We discuss the implications of these results for the study of multilevel selection and evolutionary transitions. We conclude by sketching some perspectives for future research, with a particular emphasis on the topics of evolutionary branching, criticality, spatial fluctuations and experimental tests of theoretical predictions.

annote = {Cited by Hutton (Evolvable self-replicating molecules in an artificial chemistry).

This paper is motivated by previous attempts (by Bedau et al) to characterise artificial systems capable of open-ended evolution at the same level as the one observed in the natural world.

Bedau introduces the concept of a "component" as a unit of measure of the evolutionary dynamics of a system, natural or artificial. A component's activity is defined as the number of time steps the component has existed since its first appearance. In other words, a component's activity is its age.

1. Diversity of the system: Number of components that at a given time have an activity (age) greater than zero.
2. Mean cumulative activity: Average activity (average age) of all components at a given time.
3. New adaptive activity per component: the number of components whose activity (age) is greater than a given threshold divided by the total diversity at a given moment.

During the first changes a system experiences towards increasing complexity there's a phase called "growth" where the system has not reached yet the resource limits of the model. In the case of the Earth, it is arguable that life is in the growth phase because most of the energy received remains unused.

Requirement 1: An open-ended evolutionary system must demosntrate unbounded diversity during its growth phase.
Requirement 2: an open-ended evolutionary system must embody selection.
Requirement 3: An open-ended evolutionary system must exhibit continuing ("positive") new adaptive activity.

The author argues that Bedau's startegy may sometimes fail to notice adaptive activity if natural selection does not happen to preserve components for relatively long periods of time.},

However, for many complex probability models, such likelihoods are either impossible or computationally prohibitive to obtain. Here we present a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for generating observations from a posterior distribution without the use of likelihoods. It can also be used in frequentist applications, in particular for maximum-likelihood estimation. The approach is illustrated by an example of ancestral inference in population genetics.

abstract = {We consider a social game with two choices, played between two relatives, where roles are assigned to individuals so that the interaction is asymmetric. Behaviour in each of the two roles is determined by a separate genetic locus. Such asymmetric interactions between relatives, in which individuals occupy different behavioural contexts, may occur in nature, for example between adult parents and juvenile offspring. The social game considered is known to be equivalent to a donation game with non-additive payoffs, and has previously been analysed for the single locus case, both for discrete and continuous strategy traits. We present an inclusive fitness analysis of the discrete trait game with roles and recover equilibrium conditions including fixation of selfish or altruistic behaviour under both behavioural contexts, or fixation of selfish behaviour under one context and altruistic behaviour under the other context. These equilibrium solutions assume that the payoff matrices under each behavioural context are identical. The equilibria possible do depend crucially, however, on the deviation from payoff additivity that occurs when both interacting individuals act altruistically.},

A parallel thread of evolutionary theory holds that selection between groups is also a candidate explanation for social evolution. The mathematical equivalence of these two approaches has long been known. Several recent papers, however, have objected that inclusive fitness theory is unable to deal with strong selection or with non-additive fitness effects, and concluded that the group selection framework is more general, or even that the two are not equivalent after all. Yet, these same problems have already been identified and resolved in the literature. Here, I survey these contemporary objections, and examine them in the light of current understanding of inclusive fitness theory.},

abstract = {Many natural and artificial decision-making systems face decision problems where there is an inherent compromise between two or more objectives. One such common compromise is between the speed and accuracy of a decision. The ability to exploit the characteristics of a decision problem in order to vary between the extremes of making maximally rapid, or maximally accurate decisions, is a useful property of such systems. Colonies of the ant Temnothorax albipennis (formerly Leptothorax albipennis) are a paradigmatic decentralized decision-making system, and have been shown flexibly to compromise accuracy for speed when making decisions during house-hunting. During emigration, a colony must typically evaluate and choose between several possible alternative new nest sites of differing quality. In this paper, we examine this speed-accuracy trade-off through modelling, and conclude that noise and time-cost of assessing alternative choices are likely to be significant for T. albipennis. Noise and cost of such assessments are likely to mean that T. albipennis' decision-making mechanism is Pareto-optimal in one crucial regard; increasing the willingness of individuals to change their decisions cannot improve collective accuracy overall without impairing speed. We propose that a decentralized control algorithm based on this emigration behaviour may be derived for applications in engineering domains and specify the characteristics of the problems to which it should be suited, based on our new results.},

Colonies of the ant Temnothorax albipennis (formerly Leptothorax albipennis) are a paradigmatic decentralized decision-making system, and have been shown flexibly to compromise accuracy for speed when making decisions during house-hunting. During emigration, a colony must typically evaluate and choose between several possible alternative new nest sites of differing quality. In this paper, we examine this speed-accuracy trade-off through modelling, and conclude that noise and time-cost of assessing alternative choices are likely to be significant for T. albipennis. Noise and cost of such assessments are likely to mean that T. albipennis' decision-making mechanism is Pareto-optimal in one crucial regard; increasing the willingness of individuals to change their decisions cannot improve collective accuracy overall without impairing speed. We propose that a decentralized control algorithm based on this emigration behaviour may be derived for applications in engineering domains and specify the characteristics of the problems to which it should be suited, based on our new results.},

Here we present a model of such a population and describe how its examination yielded the realization that different classes of viscous populations exist with differing levels of support for reciprocal cooperation. Specifically we find from our model that, in a spatially distributed population with increased viscosity, the reciprocally cooperative tit-for-tat strategy may not be globally stable due to a corresponding increase in local population density.},

The authors argue that the constraints imposed by the model of J{\&}F (reference [4]) facilitate the emergence of overconfidence (Box1, page 2). The authors argue that this is because these restrictions make it favourable for an individual to engage in a fight only if its estimated probability of success is above 0.5, which understandably can happen through overconfidence.


The authors present a similar situation (Box 2, page 3) where an individual must decide whether or not to claim a resource when the environment is "good" or "bad" and show the optimal decision rule an individual must follow given the evidence.


The authors claim that any rule other than than stated in box 2 should be equivalent in action (if some variable is distorted then another must also be distorted to compensate) (page 3, paragraph 2). It seems to me that that's exactly what's happening with J{\&}F's model: one variable (overconfidence) emerges to compensate for an individual's inability to estimate in advance V and C.


Later the authors consider the influence that self-deception may have on the objective probability of success. An individual stating a commitment to always contest (regardless of actual or perceived capability) may lead a stronger but rational rival to decline contesting a low-value resource, "the first player to choose can indeed determine the equilibrium of the game" (page 4, paragraph 1).


Thge authors propose to extend J{\&}F's model as follows: individuals must (1) signal one biased estimate of their own capabilities (i.e. signal their own k) and (2) make decisions about whether to engage in conflict based on a second estimate of their own capabilities. "If there is assumed to be no cost for doing so, individuals should dissociate their projected capability from their assesment of their own capability" (page 4, column 1, paragraph 2).


Summarising: the extended model must include two types of individuals, Type II (who signal a biased capability of themselves to others AND believe that same biased capability) and Type II (who signal a biased capability but their estimation of themselves is different).




In summary:


J{\&}F model overconfidence (only self-deception, no deception).


Marshall et al. point out that self-deception (overconfidence) is required in order to deceive others, according to Trivers.


That is, in order to appear confident to others and deceive them an individual must deceive itself first. Marshall et al. conclude that the abiluty to deceive other is subject to the constraint of self-deceiving first. 


Clearly the main problem is the stability of self-deception. It may owrk when mating but not in situations of conflict.


It could be argued that evolution should shape individuals to ignore false cluse and pay attention to truthful ones only.




The issue of unstability has pointer out by critics but Trivers does not refer to this issue.


It has been shown that rational agents can depart from Nash equilibria when they communicate to others their commitment to a future action. Therefore a bluffer could convince a stong. rational to back away to avoid conflict.


The stability of self-deception can be modelled if an individual signals to theirs its capabuluty plus bias and acts oin this information.


The 'restrictions' could be removed from such model by allowing individuals signal one estimate and act on a private one.

@article{Matsumaru2006,
annote = {The study of chemical evolution is divided in two approaches: replicator centred and network centred.

Replicator centred: quasispecies, RNA.

Network centred: evolution of autocatalytic networks. An autocatalytic system is composed of molecules that can replicate using other molecules in the same set as catalysts.

A constructive system is such that new components (molecular species) may appear.

A chemical organisation is a set of molecular species that is closed and self-maintaining.

Closure: reactions involving species in the organisation can only produce species already in the organisation.

Self-maintenance: All species in the organisation are produced by rules involving only species in the organisation, i.e., species are not consumed indefinitely until extinction.

The state of the reaction vessel at a given time: the current concentration of the vessel at that time.

A problem addressed in this document is, given an algebraic chemistry (M,R) find all possible chemical organisations.

More specifically, given a current state of the reaction vessel, identify what organisations can be reached from that state.

An organisation is expanded or explored from a state with the following algorithm: get the set of species in the current state, generate the smallest closure of that set and then generate the largest self-maintaining set of that closure.

There are two different "evolutions". One is the evolution of the reaction vessel, i.e., the state or concentration vector. The other is the evolution of the resepctive organisation.

Organisation evolution can occur in three directions (respective to the corresponding Hasse diagram): upward (a species is added), downward (a species is lost), and sideward (typically a combination of the previous two movements, some species are lost and some others are introduced).

This document presents an artificial chemistry where molecular species are represented as binary strings of length 32. Reactions take place with two reactants producing one new molecule that replaces only one of the reactants (chosen randomly). Each time step two reactants are selected randomly. The reaction itself is catalytic, because none of the reactants is affected but one of them is removed forcibly (by decay) as part of the simulation.

Thsi chemistry suffers the same problem Hutton described about cellular automata: matter is simply created.

In the first simulation the reactor vessel starts with 1000 species and a certain number of organisations but both figures decrease as time progresses. The organisation evolution moves downward.

Upward movement is observed only when mutation is introduced by selecting ten molecules every hundred time steps and negating one of their bits.

An experiment shows that evolution of the reactor does not necessarily imply a change in the organisation generated, i.e., change in the reactor may not result in change of the organisation.

The most evident result from this paper is that even though reaction evolution and organisation evolution are related, one does not necessarily imply the other.},

abstract = {Error management theory is a theory of considerable scope and emerging influence. The theory claims that cognitive biases do not necessarily reflect flaws in evolutionary design, but that they may be best conceived as design features. Unfortunately, existing accounts are vague with respect to the key concept of bias. The result is that it is unclear that the cognitive biases that the theory seeks to defend are not simply a form of behavioral bias, in which case the theory reduces to a version of expected utility theory. We propose some clarifications and refinements of error management theory by emphasizing important distinctions between different forms of behavioral and cognitive bias. We also highlight a key assumption, that the capacity for Bayesian beliefs is subject to constraints. This assumption is necessary for what we see as error management theory's genuinely novel claim: that behavioral tendencies to avoid costly errors can rest on systematic departures from Bayesian beliefs and that the latter can be adaptive insofar as they generate the former. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In the late 1940s John von Neumann began to work on what he intended as a comprehensive 
"theory of [complex] automata." He started to develop a book length manuscript on the subject in 
1952. However, he put it aside in 1953, apparently due to pressure of other work. Due to his 
tragically early death in 1957, he was never to return to it. The draft manuscript was eventually 
edited, and combined for publication with some related lecture transcripts, by Burks in 1966. It is 
clear from the time and effort that von Neumann invested in it that he considered this to be a very 
significant and substantial piece of work. However, subsequent commentators (beginning even with 
Burks) have found it surprisingly difficult to articulate this substance. Indeed, it has since been 
suggested that von Neumann's results in this area either are trivial, or, at the very least, could 
have been achieved by much simpler means. It is an enigma. In this paper I review the history of 
this debate (briefly) and then present my own attempt at resolving the issue by focusing on an 
analysis of von Neumann's problem situation. I claim that this reveals the true depth of von 
Neumann's achievement and influence on the subsequent development of this field, and further that 
it generates a whole family of new consequent problems, which can still serve to inform - if not 
actually define - the field of artificial life for many years to come.},

The author claims that the true motives of John von Neumann's work on an universal 
self-replicators were actually the growth of complexity: the ability of one machine to manufacture 
another one of greater complexity.

He argues that recent work that extends that of von Neumann's offers more simplicity but their 
achievements are about the same relevance and essentially adaptations of von Neumann's.

A formal definition of a self-replicator is vague and so it is the definition of complexity. A 
single cell in a cellular automaton could be considered self-replicative just by devising the 
correct rule to do so.

Burke attempted to define complexity as the ability to carry out universal computation. This 
definition would include von Neumann's replicator and exclude the single cell replicator example.

This criterion (universal computation) is not widely accepted, mainly because it is not easily 
observable in natural organisms. Also because self-replication does not necessarily require complex 
machinery.

Langton suggested that a general structure of self-replicating systems must include a genotype 
(copied to offspring) and a phenotype (the active parts of the organism as a result of the decoding 
of the genotype). Langton's own self-replicators in CA follow this pattern and are simpler than the 
model suggested by von Neumman.

The author nonetheless argues that the main objective of von Neumann was not self-replication but 
the evolutionary growth of complexity and that self-replication was merely a (necessary) means to 
that end. The author cites von Neumann mentioning the "triviality" of self-replication in growing 
crystals as evidence that von Neumann was interested in something beyond that: the growth of 
complexity, even though he apparently made no efforts in providing a formal definition of 
complexity although did imply that the primitive or atomic parts from which to build the complex 
system would have to be chosen arbitrarily.

The author argues Langton's loops do not solve the problem of evolutionary growth of complexity, as 
posed by von Neumann, since they seemingly offer no evolvability. The author also argues that 
Tierra does not fully solve the problem since the evolvability of the system does not include the 
mechanisms by which the information is decoded as opposed to a more general replicator where this 
mechanism would be potentially mutable and the language with which the information is encoded would 
be evolvable itself.

This latter situation (genetic absolutism in loops and Tierra) leads the author to propose the 
alternative genetic relativism where the mapping from genotype to phenotype may not be fixed but 
may vary from one organism to another. Even though this may imply some other complications, the 
author affirms it is necessary to understand that genetic absolutism is not a requirement of 
evolution, just a pragmatic choice and that its use assumes the existence of the full framework 
from the beginning (the replicator with its fixed-language genetic code) without explaining how 
that machinery could have emerged in the first place.

The author leaves several open problems/questions which include how and evolutionary process could 
have produced one replicator in the first place (and suggests genetic relativism as an answer, 
instead of geentic absolutism even though the latter is simpler) and what the conditions are to 
enable an actual growth of complexity instead of a theoretical model. Von Neumann's, for example, 
would have hardly produced this growth of complexity as he knew it himself.

The foraging policy which maximises mean reward rate for the environment is characterised in terms of a function of state called the potential function. This policy is shown to be given by the rule: continue foraging on the present patch while the potential is positive, when the potential falls to zero move on to the next patch. Let r denote the current reward rate on a patch and let ? denote the maximum mean reward rate for the environment. It is shown that r ? if it is optimal to leave. Conditions which ensure r {\textless} ? are also given. For a large class of environments the optimal policy is stated in terms of a revised reward rate , and is given by the rule: continue on the present patch while , when falls to ? move on to the next patch.

I argue that, in maximising survival probability, risk-averse behaviour is much more important than risk-prone behaviour. I also argue that animals in the laboratory will continue to use rules which are adapted to food sources which change over time. A model of environmental change is investigated. This model predicts that a consequence of change is that less risk-prone behaviour than that predicted by standard models is to be expected in laboratory studies. The need to learn about a stochastic food source in a changing environment is predicted to further reduce the incidence of risk-prone behaviour. It is difficult to learn about highly variable food sources. This is shown to lead to risk-aversion even when the optimisation criterion is maximisation of mean long-term rate of food gain. Implications of the general modelling philosophy are discussed.},

abstract = {Bayesian decision theory can be used to model animal behaviour. In this paper we give an overview of the theoretical concepts in such models. We also review the biological contexts in which Bayesian models have been applied, and outline some directions where future studies would be useful. Bayesian decision theory, when applied to animal behaviour, is based on the assumption that the individual has some sort of “prior opinion” of the possible states of the world. This may, for example, be a previously experienced distribution of qualities of food patches, or qualities of potential mates. The animal is then assumed to be able use sampling information to arrive at a “posterior opinion”, concerning e.g. the quality of a given food patch, or the average qualities of mates in a year. A correctly formulated Bayesian model predicts how animals may combine previous experience with sampling information to make optimal decisions. We argue that the assumption that animals may have “prior opinions” is reasonable. Their priors may come from one or both of two sources: either from their own individual experience, gained while sampling the environment, or from an adaptation to the environment experienced by previous generations. This means that we should often expect to see “Bayesian-like” decision-making in nature.},

This integration is timely because there is a growing awareness of the importance of environmental complexity in shaping behaviour; there are established and effective computational procedures for simulating evolution and there is rapidly increasing knowledge of the neuronal basis of decision-making.

The authors conclude by saying that models can be used in order to investigate how rules should perform in environments with varying degrees of uncertainty.

Their hypothesis is that if the rule used by an individual is flexible then natural selection should shape the parameters of this rule, tuning them in order to produce the a rule that performs well on average.

On the other hand, non-flexible decision rules should be expected to evolve in such a manner that they still generally perform well on average.

Behaviours favored by natural selection should be expected to be optimal, on average, even if they are the result of behavioural mechanisms that are not optimal in all cases.},

abstract = {We propose operational definitions of reproductive optimism and pessimism; optimism involves behaving in a way that gives too much weight (in terms of producing surviving offspring) to positive events, pessimism gives too much weight to negative events. Natural selection maximizes the long-term growth of a lineage rather than short-term measures such as numbers of offspring. Consequently, optimism or pessimism can be favoured by natural selection, even though such biases appear irrational from a short-term perspective. We investigate the evolution of optimism in a metapopulation. The circumstances of a patch change over time, independently of other patches. With sufficient dispersal between patches, stochasticity affects members of a lineage largely independently and optimism is favoured. With little dispersal, the temporal fluctuations of a patch affect many members similarly; pessimism is then favoured. Our results establish that the spatial and temporal structure of the environment is crucial in determining the direction of evolved biases.},
annote = {The purpose of this paper is to determine whether optimism or pessimism are adaptive in a chaging environment. 'Optimism' and 'pessimism' refer to an individual's bias in its default estimate of the environment state.

One example is that of an individual in an environment that is expected to be either hot or cold. The individual does not 'know' in advance what the state of the environment will be. The individual's phenotype can be developed to offer varying degrees of insulation. But too much of it in a hot environment or too little in a cold one will result in death.

Given the above, the questions is whether a population of individuals should evolve to reflect the true probability that the environment is in one state.

A model is proposed where an individual lives in an environment that can be either in state A or B. The individual has a trait denoted by u and the individual's expected number of offspring in environment A and B is denoted by r{\_}A(u) and r{\_}B(u), respectively. The actual probability that the environment is in state B is denoted by p.

Box 1 defines the mean number of offspring left by an individual, given its trait, u, and the probability of environment state B, denoted by p. This mean is denoted by W(p,u). The fitness of the individual is defined as this mean, given the individual's trait, u, and the rate of indivivuals with the same trait in environment B. This rate is denoted by p(u) and thd individual's fitness is gien by W(p(u),u).

In the end the model serves to show that apparent irrational behaviour is favoured by natural selection. 'Irrational' in this case means a behaviour that does not maximise a short-term interest. In the model, two currencies pertain to an individual. The first is the number of offspring which is short-term. The second is fitness, which is long term. In the model the second currency does not necessarily require the other. Indeed, there is a trade-off between the two. Therefore fitness is not simply a matter of leaving as many offspring as possible. Thus individuals do not necessarily evolve to maximise their number of offspring. This evolved behaviour is what the authors call 'irrational.'


In the model, fitness is denoted as W(p,u) and defined as a function of the probability of the environment being hot (i.e., p) and the level of insulation of the individual (i.e., u).

Given this definition of fitness there are two probabilities to consider. The true probability that the environment is hot is denoted by p*. This is the objective probability. For an individual with trait u0, the probability that would maximise its fitness is denoted by p{\_}S. This is the subjective probability.

The individual's 'optimism' or 'pessimism' depends on whether the subjective probability is above or below the objective probability.

Since there are only two possible environments, an individual's subjective probability implicity indicates which environment the individual 'thinks' is most likely. That is to say, the individual 'thinks' that B occurs with probability p{\_}S (the subjective probability) and that A occurs with probability 1 - p{\_}S.

At any time, one environment, either A or B, provides the best reproduction rate to the individual. Thus this reproduction-maximising environment is the 'good' environment. 

If the individual 'thinks' that the 'good' environment is more likely than it objectively is, then the individual is optimistic.

If the individual 'thinks' that the 'good' environment is less likely than it objectively is, then the individual is pessimistic.

Example, if B is the good environment AND p{\_}S {\textgreater}p* then the individual is optimistic.

If A is the good environment AND (1-p{\_}S) {\textgreater} (1 - p*) then the individual is optimistic.

If B is the good environment AND p{\_}S {\textless} p* then the individual is pessimistic.

If A is the good environment AND (1-p{\_}S) {\textless} (1-p*) then the individual is pessimistic.


When there is spatial variation and no temporal variation (i.e., patches remain in the same state, either hot or cold) and most patches are hot or most patches are cold then individuals evolve to become optimistic. When most patches are cold individuals evolve *less* insulation than would maximise their number of offspring. On the other hand when most patches are hot then individuals evolve *more* insulation than would maximise their number of offspring. That is to say, individuals do not evolve to maximise their number of offspring.

Results are different when temporal variation in a single patch is considered instead. In this case pessimism evolves. That is to say, individuals evolve to overestimate the probability of a bad environment.},

abstract = {Demography is central to both ecology and evolution, and characterizing the feedback between ecology and evolution is critical for understanding organisms' life histories and how these might evolve through time. Here, we show how, by combining a range of theoretical approaches with the statistical analysis of individually structured databases, accurate prediction of life history decisions is possible in natural density-regulated populations undergoing large fluctuations in demographic rates from year to year. Our predictions are remarkably accurate and statistically well defined. In addition, we show that the predicted trait values are evolutionarily and convergence stable and that protected polymorphisms are possible.},

abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a popular approach to address inference problems where the likelihood function is intractable, or expensive to calculate. To improve over Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementations of ABC, the use of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods has recently been suggested. Most effective SMC algorithms that are currently available for ABC have a computational complexity that is quadratic in the number of Monte Carlo samples (Beaumont et al., Biometrika 86:983–990, 2009; Peters et al., Technical report, 2008; Toni et al., J. Roy. Soc. Interface 6:187–202, 2009) and require the careful choice of simulation parameters. In this article an adaptive SMC algorithm is proposed which admits a computational complexity that is linear in the number of samples and adaptively determines the simulation parameters. We demonstrate our algorithm on a toy example and on a birth-death-mutation model arising in epidemiology.},

It is assumed that the fitness of an individual depends on its phenotype and the state of the environment.




Monophenic individuals always express the same phenotype and therefore they perfom well in their preferred environment and perform bad in the other.




Polyphenic individuals may change their phenotype after receiving cues to the environment and therefore they can match the current state of the environment with certain accuracy (a).




Environment states occur with a given frequency (r).

In accordance with this prediction, most of the cross-national variation in women's age at first birth can be explained by differences in female life expectancies and incomes. The within-country variation in England shows a similar pattern: women have children younger in neighbourhoods where the expectation of healthy life is shorter and incomes are lower. I consider the proximate mechanisms likely to be involved in producing locally appropriate reproductive decisions. There is evidence suggesting that developmental induction, social learning and contextual evocation may all play a role.},

abstract = {Environmental change has altered the phenology, morphological traits and population dynamics of many species. However, the links underlying these joint responses remain largely unknown owing to a paucity of long-term data and the lack of an appropriate analytical framework. Here we investigate the link between phenotypic and demographic responses to environmental change using a new methodology and a long-term (1976-2008) data set from a hibernating mammal (the yellow-bellied marmot) inhabiting a dynamic subalpine habitat. We demonstrate how earlier emergence from hibernation and earlier weaning of young has led to a longer growing season and larger body masses before hibernation. The resulting shift in both the phenotype and the relationship between phenotype and fitness components led to a decline in adult mortality, which in turn triggered an abrupt increase in population size in recent years. Direct and trait-mediated effects of environmental change made comparable contributions to the observed marked increase in population growth. Our results help explain how a shift in phenology can cause simultaneous phenotypic and demographic changes, and highlight the need for a theory integrating ecological and evolutionary dynamics in stochastic environments.},

annote = {This document asserts social learning and individual learning have been previously studied separately and that the results presented here show they both arise through Bayesian learning.

Results also show that natural selection favours those individuals who resort to imitating others when the information of the environment is not easily readable by themselves.

Results also show that a conformist bias is universal in social learning.

Essentially the experimental results depicted here show how through evolution, individuals may reach common sense decisions:

- When the environmental cue is poor, trust nd imitate the behaviour of others.

- When the environment is stable (does not change) it is a good idea to trust and imitate others.

Social learning: determinants of behaviour are transmitted socially from individual to individual.

Conformist bias: a disproportionate preference for the most common behaviour.

Theoretically the model establishes an equation that determines the optimum choice for an individual given the environmental cue and the social clue. This equation depends on a variable g whose correct value always yields perfect decisions for individuals. However these individuals never know directly the correct value of g and must guess it based on learning.

The modelling is complicated and the equations are unclear. Variables are introduced arbitrarily without being clarified and the author seems to use the word "allele" to refer to a genome.},

abstract = {To perform tasks, organisms often use multiple procedures. Explaining the breadth of such behavioural repertoires is not always straightforward. During house hunting, colonies of Temnothorax albipennis ants use a range of behaviours to organise their emigrations. In particular, the ants use tandem running to recruit na{\"{i}}ve ants to potential nest sites. Initially, they use forward tandem runs (FTRs) in which one leader takes a single follower along the route from the old nest to the new one. Later, they use reverse tandem runs (RTRs) in the opposite direction. Tandem runs are used to teach active ants the route between the nests, so that they can be involved quickly in nest evaluation and subsequent recruitment. When a quorum of decision-makers at the new nest is reached, they switch to carrying nestmates. This is three times faster than tandem running. As a rule, having more FTRs early should thus mean faster emigrations, thereby reducing the colony's vulnerability. So why do ants use RTRs, which are both slow and late? It would seem quicker and simpler for the ants to use more FTRs (and higher quorums) to have enough knowledgeable ants to do all the carrying. In this study, we present the first testable theoretical explanation for the role of RTRs. We set out to find the theoretically fastest emigration strategy for a set of emigration conditions. We conclude that RTRs can have a positive effect on emigration speed if FTRs are limited. In these cases, low quorums together with lots of reverse tandem running give the fastest emigration.},

abstract = {A central statistical goal is to choose between alternative explanatory models of data. In many modern applications, such as population genetics, it is not possible to apply standard methods based on evaluating the likelihood functions of the models, as these are numerically intractable. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a commonly used alternative for such situations. ABC simulates data x for many parameter values under each model, which is compared to the observed data x obs. More weight is placed on models under which S(x) is close to S(x obs), where S maps data to a vector of summary statistics. Previous work has shown the choice of S is crucial to the efficiency and accuracy of ABC. This paper provides a method to select good summary statistics for model choice. It uses a preliminary step, simulating many x values from all models and fitting regressions to this with the model as response. The resulting model weight estimators are used as S in an ABC analysis. Theoretical results are given to justify this as approximating low dimensional sufficient statistics. A substantive application is presented: choosing between competing coalescent models of demographic growth for Campylobacter jejuni in New Zealand using multi-locus sequence typing data.},

abstract = {Models of population divergence and speciation are often based on the assumption that differences between populations are due to genetic factors, and that phenotypic change is due to natural selection. It is equally plausible that some of the differences among populations are due to phenotypic plasticity. We use the metaphor of the adaptive landscape to review the role of phenotypic plasticity in driving genetic evolution. Moderate levels of phenotypic plasticity are optimal in permitting population survival in a new environment and in bringing populations into the realm of attraction of an adaptive peak. High levels of plasticity may increase the probability of population persistence but reduce the likelihood of genetic change, because the plastic response itself places the population close to a peak. Moderate levels of plasticity arise whenever multiple traits, some of which are plastic and others not, form a composite trait involved in the adaptive response. For example, altered behaviours may drive selection on morphology and physiology. Because there is likely to be a considerable element of chance in which behaviours become established, behavioural change followed by morphological and physiological evolution may be a potent force in driving evolution in novel directions. We assess the role of phenotypic plasticity in stimulating evolution by considering two examples from birds: (i) the evolution of red and yellow plumage coloration due to carotenoid consumption; and (ii) the evolution of foraging behaviours on islands. Phenotypic plasticity is widespread in nature and may speed up, slow down, or have little effect on evolutionary change. Moderate levels of plasticity may often facilitate genetic evolution but careful analyses of individual cases are needed to ascertain whether plasticity has been essential or merely incidental to population differentiation.},

Transcriptional profiling (gene expression profiling) refers to the measurement of the activity of a large group of genes in order to obtain a general picture of cellular function.

This paper revolves around the idea of stuying an organism's reaction to a virus infection, by conducting a gene expression profiling after infection.

Transcriptional profiling can studied after virus infection by sampling tissue from the subject. These samples are taken from different key parts of the organism after infection.

The approach proposed in this paper consists of repeated sampling over 11 consecutive days from different "compartments" of the organism (blood, lung, mediastinal lymph nodes and spleen) after influenza infection. These samples are used to study the reaction at the transcriptional level (i.e., to examine the changes in cellular function as a response to the influenza infection).

The collected data were analyzed with high-imensional ordinary differential equation models in order to reconstruct gene regulatory networks.

Strong variation was found between the four compartments. The transcriptome (i.e., the set of all mRNA) were very different.

The number of responsive genes shared by all compartments was extremely low and this indicates that responses vary greatly from compartment to compartment.},

Algorithms are developed to simulate such models in a parallel computing environment. The simulation model consists of an individual model and a population model that incorporates the individual dynamics. The individual model is a continuous time representation of organism life history for growth with discrete allocations for reproductive processes. The population model is a continuous time simulation of a nonlinear partial differential equation of extended McKendrick-von Foerster-type. As a prototypical example, we show that a specific individual-based, physiologically structured model for Daphnia populations is well suited for parallelization, and significant speed-ups can be obtained by using efficient algorithms developed along our general scheme. Because the parallel algorithms are applicable to generic structured populations which are the foundation for populations in a more complex community or food-web model, parallel computation appears to be a valuable tool for ecological modeling and simulation.},

abstract = {Patients with right hemisphere strokes sometimes vehemently deny their paralysis. I describe three new experiments that were designed to determine the extent and depth of this denial. Curiously, when asked to perform an action with their paralyzed arm, they often employ a whole arsenal of grossly exaggerated 'Freudian defense mechanisms' to account for their failure (e.g. 'I have arthritis' or 'I don't feel like moving it right now'). To explain this, I propose that, in normal individuals, the left hemisphere ordinarily deals with small, local 'anomalies' or discrepancies by trying to impose consistency in order to preserve the status quo. But when the anomaly exceeds threshold, a 'devil's advocate' in the right hemisphere intervenes and generates a paradigm shift, i.e. it results in the construction of a new model using the same data. A failure of this process in right hemisphere stroke would partially explain anosognosia. Also, our model provides a new theory for the evolutionary origin of self-deception that is different from one proposed by Trivers. And, finally, I use anosognosia as a launching-off point to speculate on a number of other aspects of human nature such as Freudian defense mechanisms, laughter, dreams and the mnemonic functions of the hippocampus.},

abstract = {Multicellularity was one of the most significant innovations in the history of life, but its initial evolution remains poorly understood. Using experimental evolution, we show that key steps in this transition could have occurred quickly. We subjected the unicellular yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to an environment in which we expected multicellularity to be adaptive. We observed the rapid evolution of clustering genotypes that display a novel multicellular life history characterized by reproduction via multicellular propagules, a juvenile phase, and determinate growth. The multicellular clusters are uniclonal, minimizing within-cluster genetic conflicts of interest. Simple among-cell division of labor rapidly evolved. Early multicellular strains were composed of physiologically similar cells, but these subsequently evolved higher rates of programmed cell death (apoptosis), an adaptation that increases propagule production. These results show that key aspects of multicellular complexity, a subject of central importance to biology, can readily evolve from unicellular eukaryotes.},
annote = {This document shows how, under conveniently devised cirsumstances, unicellular organisms may choose to cooperate with each and form multicellular structures of increasing complexity via evolution.

In the experiments described in this document, a culture of yeast cells are left to float in a liquid. The ones that tend to form clusters will settle at the bottom more quickly than the ones that choose to remain isolated. This easily allows the selection of clustering genotypes by removing the ones that remain floating. Even though this selective pressure (gravity) is not necessarily widespread in nature it is convenient to pressure for increased size.

Just after 60 changes of flasks, the population was dominated by phenotypes of approximately spherical shapes composed of several cells.

Reproduction of unicellular yeasts occurs by budding (a daughter cell identical to its mother). Reproduction of clusters occurs by production of propagules, which happens only once the cluster has reached a minimum size.

Within-Cluster division of labor is observed when some cells choose to become apoptotic (programmed death) in order to facilitate the production of smaller propagules, as required for larger clusters when they cannot grow as rapidly as when they were smaller.},

abstract = {1. Many studies have explored how plant interactions vary along environmental gradients, and these relationships are fundamental to the many ideas in vegetation dynamics. 2. It has been argued that studies should differentiate between the intensity (absolute effect) and importance (relative effect) of a process, and several important indices have been presented in the literature. 3. We explore the mathematical properties of one of the most popular of these indices (Cimp) and demonstrate that it is (i) insensitive to the underlying ecology, (ii) highly constrained, so making statistical analysis difficult and (iii) can have more complex behaviour than the processes it seeks to summarise. 4. We demonstrate that the positive relationship between Cimp and productivity, which has been used to support the ideas of Grime, is entirely predictable without any information on competition and how it affects plant performance. 5. The properties of three other competition indices (ACI, RCI and lnRR) in relation to habitat productivity are briefly presented. ACI is closely related to Cimp and so shares many of its properties, see Summary point 3 above. 6. An alternative method of analysing variation in plant performance on environmental gradients is then presented. This approach, which is based on a variance decomposition, is easy to implement and has a simple biological interpretation. 7. Synthesis. We strongly discourage the use of heuristic indices in ecological research. The majority of the 50 or so indices that have been used in competition studies have been developed with little or no regard to underlying theory or models. However, it is possible to make predictions about how competition varies along gradients from models that translate into both qualitative and quantitative conditions and metrics, and we encourage authors to do this.},

abstract = {We investigated how resources are allocated to reproduction and how variations in resource availability influence reproductive allocation, offspring number, and offspring size in guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Our goal was to evaluate how plastic these variables are in response to environmental variation and to characterize the nature of this plasticity. Female guppies which had just given birth (litter 1) were assigned to either high or low levels of food availability until they gave birth to their next litter (litter 2, interval 1). They were then randomly reassigned to either high or low food with the constraint that there be equal numbers of individuals in each of four treatments: high-high, high-low, low-high, and low-low. They were maintained on this level of food availability until they produced their next litter (litter 3, interval 2). We analyzed variables that characterized the female after the birth of the third litter and the offspring in the third litter. These were two-way analyses, with intervals 1 and 2 as the main effects and high vs. low food as the levels of each effect. The qualities of the third litter were influenced by both interbrood intervals, indicating that the resources used for producing the litter were derived from both intervals. Specifically, higher food availability during either interval resulted in a significant increase in the number of offspring in litter 3, independent of the size of the mother. This result indicates that the number of offspring produced in a litter will be a function of both the immediate and the past environment. Lower food during either interval resulted in an increase in the number of days between the second and third litters, indicating that, if resource availability is low, the female may delay the initiation of the next litter, allowing her to acquire more resources. Resource availability during both intervals also influenced how resources were allocated to individual offspring. Females responded to low food during the first interbrood interval by producing heavier offspring in litter 3. This increase in mass was almost entirely attributable to an increase in fat reserves. Such a result could represent adaptive plasticity, if it can be demonstrated that maternal fitness increases through the production of heavier offspring in a low-food environment.},

abstract = {The production of neck spines by Daphnia pulex in response to the presence of predatory Chaoborus larvae entails a demographic cost as well as a benefit in reducing predation. I develop a model that quantitatively analyzes the costs and benefits of defensive spine formation in D. pulex by modifying life tables of both the spined (SM) and typical (TM) morphs of this prey to account for the effects of different levels of Chaoborus predation on population growth rate. At low Chaoborus densities the population growth rate (and thus fitness) of TM exceeds that of SM and spine formation is therefore disadvantageous in the population. Above a critical Chaoborus density, however, the opposite is true and spine formation is favored. The exact value for this critical Chaoborus density is influenced by both food availability for Daphnia and the degree of spatial overlap between predator and prey. The model predicts that spine induction is more advantageous under relatively poor food conditions, which suggests that the cost of this antipredator defense may not be an energy loss, but merely a lengthening of the developmental process in spined instars. The model also predicts that any predator or prey behavior that reduces spatial overlap between the two species in nature will make the formation of defensive spines less advantageous.},

abstract = {Daphnia respond to kairomones from a variety of predators by altering their morphology, behavior, and life history. I use the statistical technique of meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the results of 27 independent studies that examine various life history responses of Daphnia to kairomones released from three common predators: Chaoborus, Notonecta, and planktivorous fish. Daphnia exhibit a fundamentally different set of life history responses to Chaoborus (delayed reproduction, decreased size of first clutch, slight tendency toward increased size at maturity) than they do to Notonecta and fish (earlier reproduction, increased clutch size, smaller size at maturity). These opposite responses appear to be related to different patterns of prey selection exhibited by the predators. Food level does not affect the life history responses of Daphnia to Chaoborus kairomones; however, the length of exposure to these kairomones does influence the degree of delay in reproduction. In addition, changes in size a...},

abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) have become an essential tool for the analysis of complex stochastic models. Grelaud et al. [(2009) Bayesian Anal 3:427-442] advocated the use of ABC for model choice in the specific case of Gibbs random fields, relying on an intermodel sufficiency property to show that the approximation was legitimate. We implemented ABC model choice in a wide range of phylogenetic models in the Do It Yourself-ABC (DIY-ABC) software [Cornuet et al. (2008) Bioinformatics 24:2713-2719]. We now present arguments as to why the theoretical arguments for ABC model choice are missing, because the algorithm involves an unknown loss of information induced by the use of insufficient summary statistics. The approximation error of the posterior probabilities of the models under comparison may thus be unrelated with the computational effort spent in running an ABC algorithm. We then conclude that additional empirical verifications of the performances of the ABC procedure as those available in DIY-ABC are necessary to conduct model choice.},

abstract = {Decision-making animals can use slow-but-accurate strategies, such as making multiple comparisons, or opt for simpler, faster strategies to find a 'good enough' option. Social animals make collective decisions about many group behaviours including foraging and migration. The key to the collective choice lies with individual behaviour. We present a case study of a collective decision-making process (house-hunting ants, Temnothorax albipennis), in which a previously proposed decision strategy involved both quality-dependent hesitancy and direct comparisons of nests by scouts. An alternative possible decision strategy is that scouting ants use a very simple quality-dependent threshold rule to decide whether to recruit nest-mates to a new site or search for alternatives. We use analytical and simulation modelling to demonstrate that this simple rule is sufficient to explain empirical patterns from three studies of collective decision-making in ants, and can account parsimoniously for apparent comparison by individuals and apparent hesitancy (recruitment latency) effects, when available nests differ strongly in quality. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. We present empirical data strongly suggesting that best-of-n comparison is not used by individual ants, although individual sequential comparisons are not ruled out. However, by using a simple threshold rule, decision-making groups are able to effectively compare options, without relying on any form of direct comparison of alternatives by individuals. This parsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making.},

Using the techniques used (by most automatic hypertext link generation algorithms) for inter-document link generation, we generate intra-document links between passages of a document. Based on the intra-document linkage pattern of a text, we characterize the structure of the text. We apply the knowledge of text structure to do automatic text summarization by passage extraction. We evaluate a set of fifty summaries generated using our techniques by comparing them to paragraph extracts constructed by humans. The automatic summarization methods perform well, especially in view of the fact that the summaries generated by two humans for the same article are surprisingly dissimilar.},

abstract = {Honeybee swarms and complex brains show many parallels in how they make decisions. In both, separate populations of units (bees or neurons) integrate noisy evidence for alternatives, and, when one population exceeds a threshold, the alternative it represents is chosen. We show that a key feature of a brain--cross inhibition between the evidence-accumulating populations--also exists in a swarm as it chooses its nesting site. Nest-site scouts send inhibitory stop signals to other scouts producing waggle dances, causing them to cease dancing, and each scout targets scouts' reporting sites other than her own. An analytic model shows that cross inhibition between populations of scout bees increases the reliability of swarm decision-making by solving the problem of deadlock over equal sites.},

Waggle dancing recruits others. Stop signals attempt to stop waggle dancers. After a certain number of stop signals, a threshold is exceeded and the waggle dance stops.},

abstract = {Mutually catalytic sets of simple organic molecules have been suggested to be capable of self-replication and rudimentary chemical evolution. Previous models for the behavior of such sets have analyzed the global properties of short biopolymer ensembles by using graph theory and a mean field approach. In parallel, experimental studies with the autocatalytic formation of amphiphilic assemblies (e.g., lipid vesicles or micelles) demonstrated self-replication properties resembling those of living cells. Combining these approaches, we analyze here the kinetic behavior of small heterogeneous assemblies of spontaneously aggregating molecules, of the type that could form readily under prebiotic conditions. A statistical formalism for mutual rate enhancement is used to numerically simulate the detailed chemical kinetics within such assemblies. We demonstrate that a straightforward set of assumptions about kinetically enhanced recruitment of simple amphiphilic molecules, as well as about the spontaneous growth and splitting of assemblies, results in a complex population behavior. The assemblies manifest a significant degree of homeostasis, resembling the previously predicted quasi-stationary states of biopolymer ensembles (Dyson, F. J. (1982) J. Mol. Evol. 18, 344-350). Such emergent catalysis-driven, compositionally biased entities may be viewed as having rudimentary "compositional genomes." Our analysis addresses the question of how mutually catalytic metabolic networks, devoid of sequence-based biopolymers, could exhibit transfer of chemical information and might undergo selection and evolution. This computed behavior may constitute a demonstration of natural selection in populations of molecules without genetic apparatus, suggesting a pathway from random molecular assemblies to a minimal protocell.},

Assessment of the prevalence of deception and its importance has, however, been hampered by the lack of a rigorous definition of what constitutes deception and by the anecdotal nature of much of the literature. For an interaction to qualify as deception, the receiver of the "deceptive" signal must incur a cost. While this cost is often clear in interspecific interactions, it is more difficult to evaluate in interactions between members of the same species. A systematic approach to the study of deception, including the use of experimental techniques to elicit deceptive behaviour, is now required. Such an approach may enable us to address a crucial question in social evolution - whether animals are capable of manipulating the minds of others, or merely their behaviour.},

abstract = {A large class of statistical decision models for performance in simple information processing tasks can be described by linear, first-order, stochastic differential equations (SDEs), whose solutions are diffusion processes. In such models, the first passage time for the diffusion process through a response criterion determines the time at which an observer makes a decision about the identity of a stimulus. Because the assumptions of many cognitive models lead to SDEs that are time inhomogeneous, classical methods for solving such first passage time problems are usually inapplicable. In contrast, recent integral equation methods often yield solutions to both the one-sided and the two-sided first passage time problems, even in the presence of time inhomogeneity. These methods, which are of particular relevance to the cognitive modeler, are described in detail, together with illustrative applications. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Presence of the invertebrate predator Chaoborus americanus induces Daphnia pulex to assume an alternate, less vulnerable morphology, characterized by small protuberances (neck teeth) on the dorsal anterior margin of the head. Whereas previous studies on the demographic characteristics of this induced morphology in single genotypes indicated an unavoidable "cost" (delayed maturity), the results of this study indicate substantial genetic variance for induced life-history response. In addition, the degree of neck-tooth expression, while genetically variable, is a poor predictor of clone-specific life-history changes and fitness gain in the presence of Chaoborus predation. These results reveal several important characteristics of this system of inducible defense. First, the most notable trait of the morph (neck teeth) varies among genotypes. Therefore, the induced morph does not represent an on-off state. Second, the relative expression of neck teeth among clones is a poor predictor of induced life-history changes or of relative gain in fitness in the presence of Chaoborus predation. This fact suggests that induced characteristics other than neck teeth may cause the reduced vulnerability of the induced morph. Third, the life-history consequences of induction are highly variable among genotypes, which indicates substantial genetic variance for life-history plasticity. Although some genotypes express delayed maturity in the induced morph, this is not a general result.},

The model assumes that individuals inherited a behaviour from parents and that this behaviour is later affected by the individual's own personal experiences.

The type of behaviour considered in the model is "boldness".

In the model individuals have to estimate the level of danger in the environment, which ranges from 0 (no danger) to 1 (maximum danger).

In the model individuals with varying (beta) prior means and standard deviations are considered.

Each of these individuals are exposed to exactly the same stimuli. Four stimuli in total.

Results show that posterior means increase non-linearly and the increase is higher as the prior standard deviation increases.

Results show that posterior standard deviations generally decrease with each new experience.

More general results show that individuals exhibit greater changes in behaviour during their earlier life stages.

In general behaviour becomes more stable in later life stages.},

This paper also includes an assessment of the limitations of these methods. Since Information Warfare is the battle to use information superiority for a market advantage, in assessing the value of information we must consider more than just replacement cost, but also the impact of attacks on market position. These assessments consider the market environment and the actions of potential competitors. The conclusions are that a balanced cost benefit approach is possible, but that it must consider the different types of information and must view each from the competitive perspective.},

abstract = {I present a simple model that considers how three factors-change, regularity, and value-influence the evolution of animal learning. Change and regularity are considered by introducing two terms that measure environmental persistence. One term, "between-generation persistence," defines the extent to which states in the parental generation predict states in the offspring generation; the other term, " within-generation persistence," defines the extent to which today predicts tomorrow within an individual's lifetime. Within-generation persistence is shown to be the most important of these two terms. When there is some change, increasing the within-generation persistence promotes the evolution of learning, and the between-generation persistence term has no effect. However, when the environment is almost completely fixed, then increasing change, either within or between generations, promotes the evolution of learning. This occurs because (1) the change required to promote the evolution of learning can occur either within or between generations even though (2) the regularity required to promote the evolution of learning must come within an animal's lifetime. The region of absolute fixity, in which learning does not generally evolve, is relatively small. The results for value, or payoffs, suggest that learning is most useful when all the alternatives to learning yield about the same payoff. [Behav Ecol 1991; 2: 77-89]},
annote = {From Duplicate 1 (Change, regularity, and value in the evolution of animal learning - Stephens, D. W.)

Absolute fixity argument: if learning comes at a cost, then a fixed environment should favour a fixed behaviour (i.e., no learning).

Absolute unpredictability argument: If environment changes are purely random then there is no benefit from learning.

Between-generation persistence: the extent to which the environment state experienced by parents allows the prediction of the state experienced by offspring.

Within-generation persistence: the extent to which the environment state today allows the prediction of the environment state tomorrow, all within the lifetime of an individual.


Results show that increased within-generation persistence facilitates the evolution of learning. That is to say, as the environment changes less within the lifetime of an individual, learning is more likely to evolve.

The author states that "It makes sense to learn those things that change between generations and are regulat within generations" (page 2, first column, second paragraph) when explaining Table 1. However, the author later clarifies that Table 1 only refers to extreme values and that it does not generalise to intermeediate values (page 2, first column, last paragraph).},

abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) constitutes a class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. ABC has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).},

abstract = {Aphids are important agricultural pests and also biological models for studies of insect-plant interactions, symbiosis, virus vectoring, and the developmental causes of extreme phenotypic plasticity. Here we present the 464 Mb draft genome assembly of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. This first published whole genome sequence of a basal hemimetabolous insect provides an outgroup to the multiple published genomes of holometabolous insects. Pea aphids are host-plant specialists, they can reproduce both sexually and asexually, and they have coevolved with an obligate bacterial symbiont. Here we highlight findings from whole genome analysis that may be related to these unusual biological features. These findings include discovery of extensive gene duplication in more than 2000 gene families as well as loss of evolutionarily conserved genes. Gene family expansions relative to other published genomes include genes involved in chromatin modification, miRNA synthesis, and sugar transport. Gene losses include genes central to the IMD immune pathway, selenoprotein utilization, purine salvage, and the entire urea cycle. The pea aphid genome reveals that only a limited number of genes have been acquired from bacteria; thus the reduced gene count of Buchnera does not reflect gene transfer to the host genome. The inventory of metabolic genes in the pea aphid genome suggests that there is extensive metabolite exchange between the aphid and Buchnera, including sharing of amino acid biosynthesis between the aphid and Buchnera. The pea aphid genome provides a foundation for post-genomic studies of fundamental biological questions and applied agricultural problems.},

We argue that there are many aspects of AIS that have direct parallels with SI and examine the role of AIS and SI in science and also in engineering, with the primary focus being on the immune system. We explore how in some ways, algorithms from each area are similar, but we also advocate, and explain, that rather than being competitors, AIS and SI are complementary tools and can be used effectively together to solve complex engineering problems.},

Formation of neckteeth is strongest in the second instar followed by the third instar, whereas only small neckteeth are found in the first and fourth instar of experimental clones. Predation experiments showed that body-size-dependent vulnerability of animals without neckteeth to fourth instar C. crystallinus larvae matched the pattern of neckteeth formation over the four juvenile instars. Predation experiments on D. pulex of the same clone with neckteeth showed that vulnerability to C. crystallinus predation is reduced, and that the induced protection is correlated with the degree of neckteeth formation. The pattern of neckteeth formation in successive instars is probably adaptive, and it can be concluded that neckteeth are formed to different degrees in successive instars as an evolutionary compromise to balance predation risk and protective costs.},

Hence, we would expect the theoretical basis of the conditional strategy to be robust. However, Shuster and Wade have recently criticized the conditional ESS based on Gross's 1996 proposal that most alternative reproductive tactics are conditional and have evolved by 'status-dependent selection.' We critically assess Gross's status-dependent selection model and Shuster and Wade's critique. We find shortcomings and misconceptions in both. We return to the findings of the strategic models behind the conditional ESS and demonstrate how environmental threshold models use a reaction norm approach and quantitative genetic theory to understand the evolution of conditional strategies.},

In this paper, we discuss and apply an ABC method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to estimate parameters of dynamical models. We show that ABC SMC provides information about the inferability of parameters and model sensitivity to changes in parameters, and tends to perform better than other ABC approaches. The algorithm is applied to several well-known biological systems, for which parameters and their credible intervals are inferred. Moreover, we develop ABC SMC as a tool for model selection; given a range of different mathematical descriptions, ABC SMC is able to choose the best model using the standard Bayesian model selection apparatus.},

annote = {In the model an individuals forages in a specific area (gaining vf) and if it calculates that the probability of a predator present in the area is beyond a threshold then it relocates to a safer area (by paying a cost c). If the animal does not relocate it can get killed by a predator regardless of how low the individual had estimated the probability of the predator being present.


The individual may use two types of system: the thalamic system (signal detection theory) and the cortical system (sequential probability ratio tests). The model is tested independently with each system and then combining them.


With the thalamic system the optimal decision can be calculated with signal detection theory.


With the cortical system the individual uses a sequential probability ratio test with only one finite boundary, so that the individual may reach the decision to leave the area but never reaches the decision to stay indefinitely (i.e., assuming for certain that no predators are present).


THALAMUS DECISION: With signal detection theory the animal uses only one piece of evidence (the observed x) in order to make its decision. The evidence is not accumulated.








CORTICAL DECISION: With the sequential probability ratio test the evidence is accumulated. In the individual is never allowed to reach the conclusion that there is no predator. The individual may only conclude that (i) a predator must be present or (ii) more data needs to be gathered.

abstract = {The origins of life on Earth required the establishment of self-replicating chemical systems capable of maintaining and evolving biological information. In an RNA world, single self-replicating RNAs would have faced the extreme challenge of possessing a mutation rate low enough both to sustain their own information and to compete successfully against molecular parasites with limited evolvability. Thus theoretical analyses suggest that networks of interacting molecules were more likely to develop and sustain life-like behaviour. Here we show that mixtures of RNA fragments that self-assemble into self-replicating ribozymes spontaneously form cooperative catalytic cycles and networks. We find that a specific three-membered network has highly cooperative growth dynamics. When such cooperative networks are competed directly against selfish autocatalytic cycles, the former grow faster, indicating an intrinsic ability of RNA populations to evolve greater complexity through cooperation. We can observe the evolvability of networks through in vitro selection. Our experiments highlight the advantages of cooperative behaviour even at the molecular stages of nascent life.},
annote = {This paper shows a model where (three-membered) networks of RNA evolve and have to compete against parasite autocatalytic sets and as a result of this become more complex.

Ribozymes are good candidates for the origin of life but their evolution inot catalytic networks has not been demonstrated yet. Simulations of reaction networks have been run in structured environments (e.g. automata) but, allegedly, not in a solution.

Results include a three-membered hypercycle that does not display hyperbolic growth.

AZoarcus is broken into fragments, (hopefully) these self-assemble autocatlytically if they can be altered to catalyse the replication of others, not their own.},

This is in contrast with, for example, a car factory, which is a system that operates to produce an organised entity (a car) other than the system itself (the factory).

It is basically an attempt to describe living systems.},

This automaton is an artificial genetic system composed of two classes of interacting molecules, the informants and the transformers. In the present paper, we show that such a tangled hierarchy is susceptible to give rise to general hypercycles we called tanglecycles. These tanglecycles are shown to be self-reproducing autocatalytic metabolisms. They can be considered as genuine "acellular beings" in which the information is conserved in a dynamical loop. Our phenomenological study of tanglecycles reveals the emergence of properties usually associated with life, including self-reproduction, selection and chaos. In the field of the autocatalytic networks it represents a new approach in studying the self-organization of the matter with a prebiotic point of view.},

abstract = {Our current understanding of evolution is so tightly linked to template-dependent replication of DNA and RNA molecules that the old idea from Oparin of a self-reproducing 'garbage bag' ('coacervate') of chemicals that predated fully-fledged cell-like entities seems to be farfetched to most scientists today. However, this is exactly the kind of scheme we propose for how Darwinian evolution could have occurred prior to template replication.},
annote = {Main objective of this document: to outline the requirements to enable reaction networks to act as units of evolution, whatever the underlying chemistry used. Their claim is that autocatalytic sets themselves are not units of evolution.

The authors favour Oparin's coacervate model as a hypothesis of the origin of life, as opposed to the RNA-world (as the earliest life phneomenon) hypothesis, for example.

The authors claim that the minimum requirement is the presence of cores (essentially catalytic hypercycles) and the existence of two or more attractors but always with enough stability to converge to only one of them. Networks that only have one or zero attractors and those who have two or more but never converge to any of them can never be units of evolution.

Core: Members of a hypercycle. The authors describe it as a genotype.
Peripehry: Species whose replication is catalysed by member of a core. The authors describe it as a phenotype.
Suicidal autocatalyst: one that use only reactants produced by the autocatalytic reaction itself. It can be seen as a inhibitive set of reactions (A + X {\textless}-{\textgreater} 2A) where exponential growth never occurs. Catalysts that are not suicidal are called viable and these are the ones required -according to this paper- for the evolvability of a set.

The authors stress the idea pointed out by Eigen in the sense that in a cycle (or loop) it suffices that only one of the steps is actually catalytic for replication to take place. So when only some members of the core are intially present (with enough food), the whole core and periphery can be recreated.

The authors stress the idea that the growth of a reaction network is linked to the catalytic probability of the system. They mention results of Hordjik and Steel including the hypothesis that when the probability of catalysis of molecules (the probability that a molecule is able to catalyse any given reaction) reaches some threshold, a chain reaction is triggered and due to catalytic closure autocatalytic sets appear. Hordjina dn Steel tested this claim by generating random networks of reversible ligation/cleavage reactions between molecules of length up 20 where each had a probability P of catalysing a reaction.

Additionaly the authors test (p7) the system with a parameter K, representing the inhibition level of each molecule (inhibition meant as the total elimination of one molecule by another) but they conclude that inhibition does not qualitatively prevent the formation of large catalytic reaction networks.

*******************************
Experiment 1: Emergence of a catalytic set in a chemical network
An experiment is made with a chemical population in order to search for autocatalytic sets. Parameters of the simulation are the maximum length of the polymers in the set (M) and the probability that a molecule catalyses a reaction (P). When this two parameters become higher it becomes more likely that the number of reactions and different species increase beyond a threshold (Fig 3, A). A problem was detected since an increase in the maximum length of polymers results in a faster growth of the number of reactions potentially rendering ALL molecules as catalytic, which is deemed by the authors are utterly unrealistic.
*******************************
Experiment 2: evolvability of an autocatalytic set
The network is divided in compartments. Fitness is defined as the total (non-food species) mass of the compartment. Reproduction occurs by division of the compartments into propagules. When a compartment reaches a threshold size, it divides and the two daughter propagules replace their parent and another compartment that is randomly selected, in a Moran process.

The evolvability of the population of compartments can be ensured by providing "rare reactions", i.e., rare (possibly random) uncatalysed reactions involving food species where one of the non-food species is produced triggering the production of others within the same core and the ones in the periphery. Mutation is then introduced by (1) "rare reactions" that alter randomly (but midly) the contents of each compartment and (2) compartment division may yield in a daughter compartment where some loss of species occurs.

Conclusions: networks with only one attractor can never be units of evolution. Neither can molecular networks that never converge.

Conclusion {\#}2: For a catalytic network to be evolvable, it needs to be compartmentalized, and have several attractors but converge to only one.},

@article{Vasas2010,
abstract = {A basic property of life is its capacity to experience Darwinian evolution. The replicator concept is at the core of genetics-first theories of the origin of life, which suggest that self-replicating oligonucleotides or their similar ancestors may have been the first "living" systems and may have led to the evolution of an RNA world. But problems with the nonenzymatic synthesis of biopolymers and the origin of template replication have spurred the alternative metabolism-first scenario, where self-reproducing and evolving proto-metabolic networks are assumed to have predated self-replicating genes. Recent theoretical work shows that "compositional genomes" (i.e., the counts of different molecular species in an assembly) are able to propagate compositional information and can provide a setup on which natural selection acts. Accordingly, if we stick to the notion of replicator as an entity that passes on its structure largely intact in successive replications, those macromolecular aggregates could be dubbed "ensemble replicators" (composomes) and quite different from the more familiar genes and memes. In sharp contrast with template-dependent replication dynamics, we demonstrate here that replication of compositional information is so inaccurate that fitter compositional genomes cannot be maintained by selection and, therefore, the system lacks evolvability (i.e., it cannot substantially depart from the asymptotic steady-state solution already built-in in the dynamical equations). We conclude that this fundamental limitation of ensemble replicators cautions against metabolism-first theories of the origin of life, although ancient metabolic systems could have provided a stable habitat within which polymer replicators later evolved.},

In the present experiment, subjects were interviewed twice. During one interview, they told the truth, and during the other interview, they lied. In the information-present condition, before both interviews, subjects were told that deception is usually associated with a decrease in movements. In the information-absent condition, no information was given. The results revealed that whereas subjects believed that they increased their movements during deception, a decrease in movements, in fact, occurred. Provision of information about deceptive behavior had no effect. The results also showed that a decrease in movements was associated with attempted control and cognitive load processes, and occurred independently from the tension experienced by deceivers.},

abstract = {There is great potential for host-based gene expression analysis to impact the early diagnosis of infectious diseases. In particular, the influenza pandemic of 2009 highlighted the challenges and limitations of traditional pathogen-based testing for suspected upper respiratory viral infection. We inoculated human volunteers with either influenza A (A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) or A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2)), and assayed the peripheral blood transcriptome every 8 hours for 7 days. Of 41 inoculated volunteers, 18 (44{\%}) developed symptomatic infection. Using unbiased sparse latent factor regression analysis, we generated a gene signature (or factor) for symptomatic influenza capable of detecting 94{\%} of infected cases. This gene signature is detectable as early as 29 hours post-exposure and achieves maximal accuracy on average 43 hours (p = 0.003, H1N1) and 38 hours (p-value = 0.005, H3N2) before peak clinical symptoms. In order to test the relevance of these findings in naturally acquired disease, a composite influenza A signature built from these challenge studies was applied to Emergency Department patients where it discriminates between swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 (2009) infected and non-infected individuals with 92{\%} accuracy. The host genomic response to Influenza infection is robust and may provide the means for detection before typical clinical symptoms are apparent.},

abstract = {The gene regulation network (GRN) is a high-dimensional complex system, which can be represented by various mathematical or statistical models. The ordinary differential equation (ODE) model is one of the popular dynamic GRN models. High-dimensional linear ODE models have been proposed to identify GRNs, but with a limitation of the linear regulation effect assumption. In this article, we propose a sparse additive ODE (SA-ODE) model, coupled with ODE estimation methods and adaptive group LASSO techniques, to model dynamic GRNs that could flexibly deal with nonlinear regulation effects. The asymptotic properties of the proposed method are established and simulation studies are performed to validate the proposed approach. An application example for identifying the nonlinear dynamic GRN of T-cell activation is used to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {The immune response to viral infection is regulated by an intricate network of many genes and their products. The reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using mathematical models from time course gene expression data collected after influenza infection is key to our understanding of the mechanisms involved in controlling influenza infection within a host. A five-step pipeline: detection of temporally differentially expressed genes, clustering genes into co-expressed modules, identification of network structure, parameter estimate refinement, and functional enrichment analysis, is developed for reconstructing high-dimensional dynamic GRNs from genome-wide time course gene expression data. Applying the pipeline to the time course gene expression data from influenza-infected mouse lungs, we have identified 20 distinct temporal expression patterns in the differentially expressed genes and constructed a module-based dynamic network using a linear ODE model. Both intra-module and inter-module annotations and regulatory relationships of our inferred network show some interesting findings and are highly consistent with existing knowledge about the immune response in mice after influenza infection. The proposed method is a computationally efficient, data-driven pipeline bridging experimental data, mathematical modeling, and statistical analysis. The application to the influenza infection data elucidates the potentials of our pipeline in providing valuable insights into systematic modeling of complicated biological processes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the fundamental problems in time course gene expression data analysis is to identify genes associated with a biological process or a particular stimulus of interest, like a treatment or virus infection. Most of the existing methods for this problem are designed for data with longitudinal replicates. But in reality, many time course gene experiments have no replicates or only have a small number of independent replicates. RESULTS: We focus on the case without replicates and propose a new method for identifying differentially expressed genes by incorporating the functional principal component analysis (FPCA) into a hypothesis testing framework. The data-driven eigenfunctions allow a flexible and parsimonious representation of time course gene expression trajectories, leaving more degrees of freedom for the inference compared to that using a prespecified basis. Moreover, the information of all genes is borrowed for individual gene inferences. CONCLUSION: The proposed approach turns out to be more powerful in identifying time course differentially expressed genes compared to the existing methods. The improved performance is demonstrated through simulation studies and a real data application to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: H1N1 influenza viruses were responsible for the 1918 pandemic that caused millions of deaths worldwide and the 2009 pandemic that caused approximately twenty thousand deaths. The cellular response to such virus infections involves extensive genetic reprogramming resulting in an antiviral state that is critical to infection control. Identifying the underlying transcriptional network driving these changes, and how this program is altered by virally-encoded immune antagonists, is a fundamental challenge in systems immunology.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Genome-wide gene expression patterns were measured in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) infected in vitro with seasonal H1N1 influenza A/New Caledonia/20/1999. To provide a mechanistic explanation for the timing of gene expression changes over the first 12 hours post-infection, we developed a statistically rigorous enrichment approach integrating genome-wide expression kinetics and time-dependent promoter analysis. Our approach, TIme-Dependent Activity Linker (TIDAL), generates a regulatory network that connects transcription factors associated with each temporal phase of the response into a coherent linked cascade. TIDAL infers 12 transcription factors and 32 regulatory connections that drive the antiviral response to influenza. To demonstrate the generality of this approach, TIDAL was also used to generate a network for the DC response to measles infection. The software implementation of TIDAL is freely available at http://tsb.mssm.edu/primeportal/?q=tidal{\_}prog.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We apply TIDAL to reconstruct the transcriptional programs activated in monocyte-derived human dendritic cells in response to influenza and measles infections. The application of this time-centric network reconstruction method in each case produces a single transcriptional cascade that recapitulates the known biology of the response with high precision and recall, in addition to identifying potentially novel antiviral factors. The ability to reconstruct antiviral networks with TIDAL enables comparative analysis of antiviral responses, such as the differences between pandemic and seasonal influenza infections.},
annote = {Terminology of the paper

TF: transcription factor. Transcription factors are proteins involved in the process of converting, or transcribing, DNA into RNA.

DC: dendritic cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells (also known as accessory cells) of the mammalian immune system. Their main function is to process antigen material and present it on the cell surface to the T cells of the immune system. They act as messengers between the innate and the adaptive immune systems (Wikipedia).

An antigen-presenting cell (APC) or accessory cell is a cell that displays antigen (Wikipedia).

An antigen is a molecule capable of inducing an immune response on the part of the host organism (Wikipedia).

Cis-regulatory module: Cis-regulatory module (CRM) is a stretch of DNA, usually 100-1000 DNA base pairs in length,[1] where a number of transcription factors can bind and regulate expression of nearby genes and regulate their transcription rates.

Objective: to construct a gene regulatory network in order to determine how the cell reacts to H1N1 infection, particularly to the influenza NS1 protein.

The influenza NS1 protein inhibits host immune responses. It especially limits both interferon (IFN) production and the antiviral effects of IFN-induced proteins, such as dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) and 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L.

The authors present TIDAL, a method for the analysis of time course data and the construction of a gene regulatory network.

TIDAL makes use of TRANSFAC.

TRANSFAC (TRANScription FACtor database) is a manually curated database of eukaryotic transcription factors, their genomic binding sites and DNA binding profiles. The contents of the database can be used to predict potential transcription factor binding sites.

In TIDAL, genes are not clustered by their expression profiles but by the time of first up-regulation. The idea is that if two genes are upregulated for the first time at the same time point then it is because they share cis-regulatory logic.

Authors assume that genes which are up-regulated at similar times share cis-regulatory logic (i.e., they are regulated by common TFs). This is an important distinction from many other methods (e.g. [9,13]), which assume common transcriptional regulation for groups of genes sharing similarity in expression across their entire time-series profiles.

In summary: identify which genes are upregulated at a given point and then find the transcription factors whose target genes were the ones upregulated at the time point.

Genes are grouped/clustered according the time of their first detected upregulation. There is one group for each time point.

Once the transcription factors are determined for each set of target genes, a network is constructed where each node is a TF.

First, all possible links (regulator -{\textgreater} target) are considered where the binding site of one TF is in the promoter region of the other TF.

For each TF a "time window" is determined, based on when the TF's mRNA is upregulated and when any of its associated TRANSFAC matrices shows significant activity.

After doing this, the network is constructed only with the links where the target is up-regulated within the regulator's activity window.

The resulting network is composed of TF that are known to be involved in host responses to viral infections.},
