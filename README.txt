NCEI'S MISSION 

NCEI's mission is data management in the broadest sense. 
We play an integral role in the nation's research into 
the environment, and at the same time provide public 
domain data to a wide group of users:
 
  -Private industry 
  -Universities and other educational facilities 
  -Research organizations
  -Federal, state, and local governments
  -Foreign governments, industry, and academia
  -Publishers and other mass media
  -The general public 

The Center works closely with contributors of 
scientific data to prepare documented, reliable data 
sets. We welcome cooperative projects with other 
government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and 
universities, and encourage data exchange.  We also 
interact with many foreign scientists, mainly through 
the World Data Center system. Through our international 
exchange, scientists around the world gain access to 
comprehensive databases.
 
NCEI'S HISTORY AND ORGANIZATION
 
NCEI was first established in 1965 as part of the 
Environmental Science and Services Administration 
(ESSA). It grew out of many scattered activities, in 
various agencies, which had their origins in the 
International Geophysical Year, 1957-1958. Since then, 
the Data Center has expanded its coverage of 
environmental disciplines. Expansion continues as 
issues such as global change become a focus of NOAA
and capture national and international attention.
